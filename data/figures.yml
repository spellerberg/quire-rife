The roads avoided the succession of high, broken mountains immediately north of the Rio Grande River and were suitable for use by loaded wagons. The Military or Lower Road was an all-season road over a natural surface and was free of snow in the winter. The location of river crossings and water sources were the major considerations in locating roads in all parts of Texas. "
