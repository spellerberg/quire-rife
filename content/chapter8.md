## San Antonio Police, 1874-1885

*“From 1874 to 1885 Tom Rife was on the city police force and won the record of a wise and valiant officer,” “Custodian of the Alamo”, San Antonio Light, February 23, 1887.*

### Thomas and Francisca Rife moved to San Antonio.

A Justice of the Peace of El Paso County married Thomas Rife and Francisca Eduarda Saenz at Fort Stockton, Texas on June 13, 1871.[^1] The groom was 48 and his bride 17-years old.[^2] It is unknown where or how Francisca Saenz and Tom Rife met but they likely met in El Paso, Texas. She told a census enumerator in 1900 that she emigrated from Mexico in the year of her marriage; alternatively, she may have met her husband in Mexico.

Tom and Francisca traveled to San Antonio, perhaps to visit and to look for work in 1871, where they visited Mrs. Lizzie Stevens, wife of Deputy Sheriff, Edward Stevens. Later, in an affidavit, she swore that she saw Thomas and Francisca’s marriage certificate in 1871 and that it bore the signature of a Justice of the Peace from Fort Stockton.[^3] Tom and Francisca moved to San Antonio in 1872; their first child was born in April 1873.

In the 1870s, San Antonio was an unusually cosmopolitan town with a mixed population of Anglos, Germans and Slavs, Mexicans and French in about equal numbers.[^4] Rife’s bilingual family lived in the Mexican part of town, attended Mass at the Mexican church and associated with Mexican politicians but Rife and his children were comfortable in and accepted by the Anglo and German communities as well.

A traveler in observed in 1855, “Many houses were roughcast on the outside; some were made of stone, some of adobe. Others were built of tree trunks-some of which were irregular and crooked-set in the ground and bound together at the top with transverse pieces of lumber, outside and inside, tied with thongs of rawhide, the interstices between the tree trunks filled with lime mortar, the roof thatched.”[^5] He was describing Jackal construction.[^6]

Between 1866 and about 1877, San Antonio City government was short of funds. Taxes tied to property values financed City government.[^7] As other taxes rose during Reconstruction, real estate values and City revenue both fell. For the first ten years after the Civil War the City struggled financially. The gas works, built in 1859, was idle because there was not enough US currency in circulation to run it.[^8] Despite this, the City was growing rapidly.[^9]

### Rife found work with the City of San Antonio.

In 1874 Rife began a 20-year career as a municipal employee in San Antonio. Perhaps his experience in the election in Fort Stockton redirected his energies toward public service His earliest contacts when he moved to San Antonio were lawmen such as Ed Stevens, Juan Cardenas,[^10] and Alejo Perez Jr. who were also politicians.[^11] Rife is referred to in the City Council minutes of October 3, 1876 as “Policeman Rife.”[^12] In a letter to the editor, a disgruntled citizen described Rife as a former “cattle impounder.”[^13]

In 1879, Perez was the 2nd Assistant Marshal of San Antonio[^14] and a well-respected citizen.[^15] He may have known Rife from the New Mexico Campaign when Perez was a Fourth Corporal in Company B of Baylor’s Command.[^16] Perez's mother, Mrs. Juana Navarro Perez Alsbury, and his aunt, Gertrudis Navarro, were in the Alamo when it fell to the Mexican army in 1836.[^17] Perez was an infant then but his mother clearly remembered what she herself lived through. Alejo’s family may have been one source of Rife’s extensive knowledge of the siege of the Alamo.

### Rife’s oldest child was born in San Antonio in 1873.

Rife’s first-born son, William Wallace Rife, was born on April 6, 1873. Although Thomas Rife’s father and brother were both named William W.[^18] the child was also named after Thomas’ former ranger captain and co-worker, William (Big Foot) Wallace. Father Guillet baptized the infant (as “Guillermo”) in San Fernando Church on May 22, 1873. The boy’s godparents were Juan Cardenas and his wife Josefa Valdez.[^19]

All the Rife children were baptized at San Fernando Church, in the Spanish-language parish of San Antonio. All had Spanish given names except for the daughters, Mary Jane and Anna. As adults, the children used the English version of their given names on surviving documents. This family was bilingual and about half the children married Anglo partners and the other half married people with Hispanic surnames. Half of the given names of the grandchildren of Thomas and Francisca Rife can be identified as Hispanic while the other half are clearly of Anglo origin. The Rife family seemed to move easily between two of the three dominant cultures in San Antonio.

When Rife chose to align himself with Ed Stevens and when he chose Juan Cardenas[^20] as his son’s godfather, he located himself within the minority of Anglo Texans who were not contemptuous of or afraid of the native-born Tejanos or Mexican-Americans. Captain Cardenas was an outspoken advocate for the Mexican community[^21] and it is unlikely that Rife, who also had strong ties to the Mexican community, would have advocated for or approved of the segregation, expulsion or disenfranchisement of San Antonio’s Mexican-American citizens.

### A second child was born in 1874.

The Rife’s second child, Thomas C. Rife Junior, was born on July 16, 1874. Father Neraz[^22] baptized him as “Tomas” at San Fernando Church on September 13, 1874. The child’s Godparents were Pedro and Rosa Caballos.[^23]

Two daughters followed in 1875 and in 1877. On December 26, 1875 the Rife’s third child and first daughter was born. She was named Mary Jane, [^24] after Rife’s younger sister, Mary Jane Wade. The Rife’s fourth child and second daughter, Francisca Eduarda, was born on May 03, 1877. Father Louis Genolin at San Fernando Cathedral baptized her more than two years later on May 29, 1879 when it was apparent that the baby would not survive. [^25] She died of small pox [^26] six days after being baptized and was buried by Father Neraz. [^27] This child was the only one of the twelve Rife children to die as an infant. Her Godmother was Dolores Cloud. [^28]

### Rife was appointed as Pound Master of the City’s dogcatchers.

The dogcatchers operated as an office of the police department. By the spring of 1877, the City Council agreed to do something about the “vagrant dog nuisance” [^29] and on June 30 newspapers reported that a dog ordinance was to be enforced. Dog owners were to buy a dog tag in order to avoid having the dog caught and impounded. There was also to be “a pound erected and a pound-master appointed, whose duty it shall be to seize and impound all dogs not provided the check or plate.” [^30] Much criticism of the program was aired in the newspapers in the next two months. Some writers stated that the effort was a failure. One writer explained it this way, “…any city dog had sense enough to escape being caught. Only pet dogs and country curs would allow the dogcatcher to approach near enough to throw his rope over their heads.” [^31] An article in the newspaper reported that even though Rife’s best roper was in jail for disturbing the peace, his department still had a good month. [^32]

### A fifth child was born in 1878.

Anna Rife, the fifth child and the third daughter of Tom and Francisca Rife, was born on June 3, 1878 when her mother already had five children under the age of five. Father Genolin baptized Anna six months after her birth on December 10, 1878 in the San Fernando church. The Godparents were Andres Garza and his wife Serafina Marquez. [^33] He, his wife and two girls lived at 712 North Frio Street in the same block as Dolores Cloud. [^34]

### Rife served the police department as a jailer.  

The combined city and county jail was located in the building known as the Bat Cave on Military Plaza. Rife’s job title was Vice City Jailer and he was also the night clerk of the Recorder’s Court. He managed the jail during the night shift. His job was to register persons arrested by policemen working during the night and keep them until their case could be heard by the Recorder’s Court the next morning. Rife worked in this job until March 1, 1879 when Officer Henry Miller resigned and Rife took his place as a regular policeman. [^35]

In 1873, the City of San Antonio appointed John Dobbin as the San Antonio City Marshal and he began to reorganize and modernize the police force. Beginning in 1875, San Antonio police officers were required to wear standard uniforms and a badge and to conceal their firearms under their uniform coats. [^36] Guards at the City jail, including Rife, wore a similar uniform. By January 1879, Phil Shardein replaced John Dobbin as City Marshal [^37] and kept the position throughout most of Rife’s career on the police force.

### The sixth child was born in 1879.

Lawrence Wade Rife was the Rife’s sixth child, born on November 19, 1879. Although the baptismal record has a birthdate in 1878, the June 1880 census listed him as 7 months old, which meant that he was born in 1879. He was almost certainly named after Lawrence Thompson Wade, the husband of Rife’s sister, Mary Jane Wade, who lived in Mississippi. Father Genolin baptized the child in San Fernando church as Lorenzo on January 6, 1882. His Godparents were Alejo E. Perez and his wife Antonia Rodrigues.[^38]

Alejo E. Perez came from an old San Antonio family and worked with Rife on the police force. Like Juan Cardenas, Perez later served as President of the Sociedad Mutualista Mexicana, a Mexican benevolent association formed in 1883. This society had 160 members in 1887-1888 and met every Saturday at the City Recorder’s Office on Military Plaza. Captain Juan Cardenas was godfather to sons of both Rife and Alejo Perez. [^39]

### Thomas Rife worked at the Bat Cave.

Until 1892 the police worked out of the combined City Hall, police station and City and County jail at the northwest corner of Military Plaza.[^40] The building dated from 1850 [^41] and was known as the Bat Cave [^42] because of the large number of bats that roosted in the building’s eaves.[^43] The two-story stone building was surrounded by a 15-foot high wall. The jail was located on the second floor while the police station and a courtroom occupied the ground floor.

### Rife became Grantee of Confederate Scrip.

In April, the Texas Legislature approved a bill giving land to disabled Civil War veterans from Texas. Rife’s certificate [^44] was for 1,280 acres of vacant, unreserved and non-appropriated public land. He was one of 2,068 men who received Confederate Scrip.[^45] To be eligible, the veteran could not own property valued at more than one thousand dollars.[^46] Just two months after receiving the grant, Rife signed a notarized bill of sale his scrip for the price of $80 to a land speculator named Jacob Kuechler of Travis County.[^47] Most grantees sold their certificates rather than bear the prohibitive costs of surveying and patenting the land. Kuechler, a civil engineer and surveyor, used the scrip to patent 1,120 acres in Zavala County.  

In November 1881, Rife was a member of the Bexar County Association of Mexican War Veterans. He was the group’s treasurer in 1887.[^48] Like most of the Association’s members, Rife was an amateur historian.[^49] In January 1884, when John (Rip) Ford, a Texas military veteran and historian, moved to San Antonio from Brownsville, he joined the Alamo Association [^50] as well as the Bexar Association of Mexican War Veterans.[^51] In 1891 he and Rife collaborated on a book about the Mexican War.[^52]

### The seventh and eighth children were born.

On February 28, 1881 Morris Wade, the Rife’s seventh child and fourth boy, was born. Morris was named Mauricio after his maternal grandfather. Father Genolin baptized the baby on January 29, 1883 in San Fernando church. [^53] Fred, baptized as Federico, was born in June 1882.[^54] Nothing is known of Fred except that he died at age 28 of Tuberculosis.[^55]

Rife moved his growing family to a different rental house in San Antonio every two or three years. In 1881-1882 the Rife family lived on the east side of Presa Street. [^56] In 1883 they lived at 428 North Laredo and in 1885 at 430 North Laredo[^57] west of San Pedro Creek in the Mexican area of town.

### Rife earned a reputation as a valiant police officer.

Beginning in 1883, Rife’s name appeared regularly in crime reports in the city newspapers. He responded to domestic disputes [^58] and arrested drunkards for raising a disturbance or cussing and throwing rocks. [^59] Sometimes he had to disarm violent or angry citizens.[^60] In March 1884, Rife and his partner arrested two men who were heard conspiring to assassinate San Antonio Police officer Jacob Coy.[^61] Earlier Coy had killed Ben Thompson and King Fisher, two men widely know for bloody and desperate acts including the killing of Jack Harris, the popular owner of the Vaudeville Theater. A gunfight erupted in the theater involving some friends of Harris and both men were killed.[^62]

In those days there were no police wagons and so it was necessary to walk the arrested person to the jail in the Bat Cave.[^63] Drunks, often visitors from out of town, occasionally fought the police.[^64] Cowboys were often arrested for riding through the streets, shooting at dogs[^65] and disturbing the peace.

Rife stayed with the San Antonio police force until he was permanently suspended on June 5, 1885 having allowed, as one of two jailers on duty, a convicted notorious highwayman named James McDaniel to escape.[^66] McDaniel and his partner had been sentenced to imprisonment for life. He loosened a stone in the bathroom wall, slipped though and climbed over the outer wall. Deputy Sheriff Ed Stevens killed McDaniel while he was resisting arrest on June 30. In Rife’s defense, one of the deputies reported, “…the cement can be picked away with fingers.”[^67]

After Rife became custodian of the Alamo, he was not expected to perform police work and his responsibility did not extend outside of the Alamo building. He was not kept on the rolls of the police force after he became the Custodian of the Alamo although he continued to carry his pistol and had the power of arrest.[^68] Alamo Plaza was a busy place; in 1893 a police station was located in a shed attached to the south wall of the Alamo church[^69] and four mounted officers were assigned to the station.[^70]

## Keeper of the Alamo, 1885-1894

*When the state became the owner of the historic Alamo fort, Captain Rife was appointed custodian of the building by the city and he held this position continuously until his death. “Death of Capt. Rife”, - San Antonio Daily Light, December 27, 1894.*

### Rife was appointed as the Keeper of the Alamo.

Rife was unemployed for only a few weeks, when on July 27, 1885, the Mayor appointed him Custodian of the Alamo [^71] at a salary of $50 per month.[^72] This was $20 per month less than he had been receiving as a policeman. However he no longer had to work at night and as the keeper of the Alamo building, he also received tips from visitors.[^73] As the number of tourists to the famous old building increased, tips may have become a significant source of his income.

### The Rife’s 9th Child Was Born.

On November 30, 1886, Peter Gay Rife was born. He was the Rife’s ninth child and fifth boy. Father Darche baptized him as Pedro on June 09, 1887. The child was named after his Godparents Peter and Mary Gaye.[^74] Peter Gaye was from France. He lived at the corner of Chavez and North East streets, where he and his wife ran a retail grocery store.[^75] His large tombstone in Fernando Cemetery Number 1 indicates that he died a wealthy man.

In 1888 Rife was 65 years old and had eight children; the oldest was a teenager and the youngest an infant. Rife’s financial situation improved when he began receiving a Mexican War Pension of $8.00 per month.[^76] On February 6, 1888 Rife purchased a building lot, measuring approximately four acres, on the east side of Pleasanton Road for a recorded price of $1 from Morgan W. and Sarah J. Newcomb Merrick.[^77] The Merrick’s were old friends.[^78]

At this time, the Rife’s oldest son was fifteen years old and apparently had left home. The boy, Will, was arrested for vagrancy. This was apparently his first arrest. The Recorder’s Court fined him $5 on April 9, 1888.[^79] The newspaper reported on August 16, 1888 that Rife and his wife had recovered from an illness and that Rife was back at work at the Alamo.[^80]

### Rife’s tenth child, Jack was born on April 21, 1889.

The newest child was baptized as Jacinto, a name that he used on the 1910 census report when he was living in Von Ormy, Texas.[^81]

Electric streetcars replaced the mule-driven trolley cars previously used in San Antonio before 1890.[^82] Rife rode the streetcar to and from his job at the Alamo. In October 1889, Rife had the misfortune to be badly shocked while getting off one of the new electric streetcars. He was carried home and remained there until he recovered.[^83] Rife, who was 66, was working at the Alamo seven days a week, from 8am to 5pm Monday through Saturday and 8am to 9am and 4pm to 5pm on Sunday.[^84]

Some of the Rife children visited their father at the Alamo. Occasionally, they signed the big book near the door set up for visitors to sign after being escorted through the ruins by Captain Rife. A reporter noted that Mary Jane Rife, age 15, and Anne Rife, age 12, visited their father at work at the Alamo on Sunday, August 24, 1890, and signed the visitor’s book.[^85] Again, three weeks later, Mary Rife was listed in the newspaper as a visitor to the Alamo on Friday, September 19.[^86] The children’s mother may have sent them to the Alamo with a message or lunch for their father or maybe they just wanted a chance to see and talk to him.

At that time the Rife family was living at 430 North Laredo Street,[^87] having been at that address for six years.[^88] This house was a few blocks west of Military Plaza near Milam Plaza and about a mile from the Alamo. On occasion, Rife opened the building at night to accommodate special requests and sometimes he brought his oldest son with him.[^89] The children could read and write and were among the narrow majority of school age children who regularly attended school.[^90] The next spring Rife was again reappointed custodian of the Alamo by the San Antonio City Council.[^91]

### Thomas Rife and Francisca renewed their wedding vows.

A priest at San Fernando Cathedral married Tom and Francisca Rife on March 17, 1891 “because the Church does not recognize civil marriages.” [^92] The couple had married in a civil ceremony in 1871 but, apparently, the record of their marriage was lost. Francisca looked for it again in 1895 but the original records of the civil marriage, which should have been in the archives of El Paso County, could not be found.[^93] Probably for this reason, the couple celebrated their twentieth wedding anniversary by getting married, this time in the Catholic Church.[^94] David Morrill Poor, an old friend of Tom’s, certified that Rife’s marriage to Francisca was his second marriage.[^95]

### The Rife’s 11th child, Ruth, was born on May 18, 1891.

Francisca was pregnant when the couple married for the second time. Ruth was almost six years old, and ready for First Communion, before she was baptized at San Fernando church on January 17, 1897.[^96] Her Godmother was Miss Josephine M. Flores.[^97]

Rife’s oldest sons were now teenagers and Rife was losing control of them. On July 20, 1891, Rife’s 12-year-old son, Lawrence, was arrested for breaking into two grocery stores.[^98] By August 4, Lawrence was out of jail on $200 bond. His accomplice, 9-1/2-year-old Jesús Lopez, and his mother were sent back to Mexico from whence they had recently come.[^99] On July 23, three days after Lawrence’s arrest, his older brother, Willie Rife, was arrested for refusing to pay for drinks he had ordered at a saloon. To make matters worse, Willie “also threw rocks” at the house of the Italian who owned the saloon.[^100] In November 1891, William, age 18 and his sister, Mary, age 16, were arrested for throwing stones at some neighbors. They were charged with disorderly conduct but the charges were later dismissed.[^101]

### Sometime in 1892 the Rife’s 12th and last child, Lucy, was born. [^102]

The family had moved again, this time to 307 Delgado Street,[^103] perhaps as a result of the rock-throwing incident. Delgado Street was a few blocks west of Colorado Street in the heart of the Mexican Westside. Rife’s commute to the Alamo was much longer now. The family had previously lived less than a mile from the Alamo and his children could visit him at his work. Now he had to travel over two miles to and from the Alamo. Rife was approaching 70-years-old and his health was failing. On March 3, 1893, Thomas Rife was reappointed by the City Council as Keeper of the Alamo. He was being paid despite the fact that it was reported that he was paralyzed.[^104] But by March 22 he was back at work at the Alamo.[^105]

On May 12, 1893, Will Rife was sent to jail for assaulting a man named José Navarro. He “was committed to jail in default of $1,000 bond.”[^106] Eight months later Will was fined $25 and released.

Rife was sick on October 3, 1893, but received his normal pay on a motion offered by Alderman Elmendorf.[^107] On February 20, 1894, by a motion of Alderman Smith, the San Antonio City Council adopted a motion to allow Tom Rife to assume his position as custodian of the Alamo “as he has recovered.”[^108] He had been reported as paralyzed.[^109] The eleven San Antonio aldermen each donated $5 to pay Rife back wages of $50 for one month’s work as the custodian.[^110] Now the Rife family was living on Warren Street, between San Pedro Creek and San Pedro Avenue, a short walk from the streetcar line.[^111] On March 4, 1894, Rife was re-elected to his position by the City Council by a vote of 11 to 1.[^112] Most City employees held their job by virtue of a system of patronage and after municipal elections city employees had to be reappointed.

In addition to his salary of $50 per month from his job at the Alamo, Rife received tips from grateful visitors and a pension of $8 per month for his service during the Mexican War.[^113] For this time and place Rife had an above average income.[^114] However, he seemed to struggle with his financial condition; he had ten or eleven children at home, the family moved frequently from one rented house to another, and his delinquent sons were a financial burden.[^115]

In 1893 or 1894 Rife’s family moved again to a house at 1224 Cameron Street, a block west of Flores and only a few blocks east of where they had lived the year before. The San Antonio Daily Light reported that on December 3, 1894, Thomas was “very ill” and that William McMaster, a San Jacinto veteran, was acting as Alamo custodian in his absence.[^116]

Rife did not recover and died[^117] at his home on Cameron Street on December 27, 1894.[^118] He had been ill for two months and died of “general debility.”[^119] The funeral was held on the following day at 10 o’clock am, as was customary.[^120] The funeral Mass was held at the San Fernando Cathedral and Rife was buried in San Antonio,[^121] almost certainly at the cemetery now called San Fernando, Number 1.[^122] “Father had such a poor funeral we had no money,” wrote daughter Annie to her sister Mary three days later.[^123] This must explain why there is no headstone today. Iron headstones were popular in the late 19th century but many were sold during the period when scrap iron was being collected for the war effort during World War II.
