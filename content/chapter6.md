## Custodian of Fort Bliss, 1861

*“...but when the civil war broke out, Rife was serving the south, and was at the surrender of Fort Bliss and, by command of General McGuffen, took charge of the garrison, and held it for the confederates”, “Custodian of the Alamo,” San Antonio Light, February 23, 1887.*

### After Abraham Lincoln was elected, the South seceded.

Less than a month after the national elections of November 1860, citizens of San Antonio held a public meeting at 10 o’clock on Saturday morning, December 1, in Military Plaza. The assembly drew up a petition calling for a secession convention.[^1]

On January 28, 1861, the Secession Convention met in Austin and approved an ordinance of secession to be submitted to the State’s voters for their approval.[^2] The voters approved the ordinance a month later; 46,129 voted for secession and 14,697 voted against it.[^3] Texas seceded from the Union despite the opposition of Governor Houston and other leading men.[^4]

The Secession Convention also passed Ordinance number one relating to the removal of Federal troops from Texas. It provided that transports, vessels, etc. necessary to facilitate the removal of troops from the state could not be seized or interfered with by citizens or state authorities.[^5] The Convention appointed a 15-man Committee of Public Safety to oversee the removal of Federal troops and to manage frontier defense. The committee in turn, sent a delegation to 8th Military District in San Antonio to make arrangements for the removal of Federal troops and the transfer of Federal property to the State.[^6]

Expecting resistance from the US Army, Ben McCullough and John Baylor raised a company of 250 volunteers to occupy the rooftops of buildings used by the US Army in San Antonio.[^7] After ten days of negotiation with Commissioners from the Committee of Public Safety, US General David M. Twiggs, commander of the 8th US Military District, ordered the 8th Infantry to abandon Fort Davis and all 19 U.S. army posts in Texas.[^8] General Twiggs agreed that all US troops would leave Texas and turn over surplus supplies and equipment to State officials.[^9]

Texas affiliated itself with the Confederate States on March 16, 1861.[^10] The governor and secretary of state refused to swear an oath to the Confederate Constitution; the Legislature declared their offices to be vacant.[^11] Two days later, District Judge Devine led the citizens of San Antonio as they took the Oath of Allegiance to the Confederacy.[^12] Delegates to the Succession Convention then passed an ordinance to ratify the Constitution of the Confederate States of America.[^13]

### All Federal troops left the State or were captured.

By mid-April, all the military posts in West Texas had been evacuated by Federal troops.[^14] After the attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Confederate Colonel Earl Van Dorn was instructed “to intercept and prevent the movement of the US troops from the State of Texas” because hostilities had begun.[^15] Texas military commanders also called for the surrender of Federal troops who had reached the Gulf Coast. The Federal troops garrisoned at Fort McIntosh in Laredo, first went to Fort Brown in Brownsville and then to the port at Indianola, expecting to board ships for the North. On April 25, 1861, after some confusion, they surrendered to Texas officers.[^16]

In the meantime, Federal troops abandoned Fort Bliss and Fort Quitman and marched to Fort Davis.[^17] The combined battalion proceeded to Fort Stockton and then marched towards the Gulf coast to be transported to the North as per the agreement between General Twiggs and the State commissioners.[^18]

On May 6, the combined garrisons of the frontier forts, all under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Isaac V.D. Reeves,[^19] arrived at San Lucas Spring, 15 miles west of San Antonio, and camped on Allen’s Hill.[^20] The 270 Federal troops were surrounded by an overwhelming force of 1,370 Confederate, state and volunteer troops led by Colonel Earl Van Dorn.[^21] The Confederates threatened to attack; on May 9, Colonel Reeve surrendered to the Confederates. The Union troops were permitted to march to San Antonio where they were held as prisoners of war.[^22] The Union officers were paroled. Some of the enlisted men were kept at San Pedro Park near San Antonio for 22 months as prisoners of war before being exchanged.[^23]

### Commissioners were appointed to safeguard government property.

The Texas Committee of Public Safety appointed Confederate commissioners to take custody of and to safeguard all Union property in the state.[^24] The Committee appointed James Magoffin as commissioner for Forts Bliss and Quitman. Before Federal troops left Forts Bliss and Quitman, James and his son, Samuel Magoffin, accepted custody of the supplies and equipment at the posts.[^25] Colonel Reeve then abandoned the fort.[^26] On April 4, 1861, Samuel Magoffin and his brother-in-law, Gabriel Valdez, received the Federal property at Fort Quitman from First Lieutenant Zenas Bliss.[^27] The contents of both forts were inventoried for transfer to the state.[^28]

On April 25, 1861, a volunteer company of Confederate partisans from San Antonio (members of a secret society called the Knights of the Golden Circle) occupied Fort Davis.[^29] Noah Smithwick wrote that in April, when he passed by Fort Quitman on his way to California, four men were guarding the fort. They were waiting for the arrival of John Baylor’s Texas troops.[^30] Fort Stockton, in a partially dismantled state, was also occupied by state troops.[^31] California-bound emigrants seeking firewood damaged both Fort Stockton and the relay stations belonging to the Overland Mail. They were ignorant of the fact that the ground was “full of mesquite grubs” (roots) that could be used for firewood.[^32]

### Thomas Rife and other men took custody of Fort Bliss.

By order of Confederate Commissioner General James Magoffin, a prominent El Paso merchant and political figure, Thomas Rife and a few other men, including S. W. Merchant, took custody of Fort Bliss.[^33] During this time, Rife was employed by Giddings’ stagecoach line, perhaps as a station agent near El Paso. Thirty-two years later, Tom Rife, in telling a story, claimed to have been at Fort Bliss on St. Patrick’s Day, March 17, 1861.[^34]

In a letter to the Texas Governor in May 1861, Josiah F. Crosby urged the Governor to raise a company or more of militia to protect the property at Fort Bliss. He recommended that Captain H. Clay Cook be authorized to raise this company. James Magoffin agreed to take the responsibility of rationing and arming the company.[^35] In a report, Colonel Earl Van Dorn, the senior Confederate officer in Texas, stated that he “has mustered into service a company of foot artillery, composed of old soldiers, under a good officer, and put them at Fort Bliss with instructions to throw up a small field-work, and to defend it with the six pieces of artillery now there.”[^36] Rife must have passed his responsibility as the fort’s custodian to this force because soon afterward he was seen driving the mail coach.[^37]

The mail service continued to run on a semi-weekly basis[^38] and mail stations continued to be manned.[^39] On July 10, 1861, Rife led a mail party near El Muerto (Dead Man’s Hole) west of Van Horn’s Well. The mail coach was headed to El Paso, Texas.[^40] Three days later, Rife and his party were reported 30 miles west of San Elizario and headed in the direction of San Antonio.[^41] The final mail coach from San Diego arrived in Mesilla on July 20.[^42]

### Confederate troops occupied the abandoned forts.

On May 7, 1861, Lt. Colonel John R. Baylor arrived in San Antonio to organize a regiment of mounted volunteers for frontier defense.[^43] This regiment, the 2nd Regiment, Texas Mounted Rifles, was detailed to occupy the vacated US military forts from Fort Brown to Fort Bliss along the Rio Grande frontier.[^44] The following month, units of Baylor’s regiment began to move west from San Antonio to occupy the forts along the San Antonio-El Paso Road. Colonel Baylor arrived at Fort Bliss in the stagecoach on July 13,[^45] and by the end of the month, Confederate troops occupied most of the abandoned military posts in West Texas.

Fort Bliss, located three miles east of Franklin (or Coontz’) ranch, was the western-most military post in Texas. Franklin's ranch was on the east bank of the Rio Grande River opposite El Paso del Norte, Mexico.[^46] In 1858, Franklin had a population of about 300 persons, three-fourths of whom were Mexicans. Irrigation ditches provided water for vineyards, fruit trees, wheat, corn and vegetable gardens. There was a saloon and a US post office (both in the same room), an outdoor market and a ferry that crossed the river to El Paso del Norte. The town was described as picturesque with ash and cottonwood trees lining the river.[^47]

However, Baylor had not traveled to Franklin merely to garrison Fort Bliss; he had a larger mission.[^48] On July 23, 1861, Baylor left his base at Fort Bliss and invaded New Mexico Territory, still under the control of the United States Army. Companies A and E, the San Elizario Spy Company and part of Teel’s Artillery Company left Fort Bliss and traveled upstream for 44 miles to attack the US force at Fort Fillmore, New Mexico. The Confederate troops by-passed the fort and occupied Mesilla, a large town just north of Fort Fillmore.[^49] The US Army garrison of Fort Fillmore marshaled in front of the town but then retreated back to the fort after a brief skirmish. On July 27, the Union garrison of Fort Fillmore abandoned the fort and began to march to Fort Stanton, 140 miles to the northeast. Baylor’s command, with some civilians from Mesilla, pursued and overtook the US troops.[^50] The Federal soldiers surrendered at San Augustine Springs without a fight. This was the first victory for the Confederates in the New Mexico campaign.[^51]

## The New Mexico Campaign, 1861-1862

*“When he had discharged that duty, he accompanied Sibley’s Brigade through New Mexico, sharing in the pains and vicissitudes of that campaign”, “Custodian of the Alamo,” San Antonio Light, February 23, 1887.*

### Gen. Henry Sibley organized a brigade to invade New Mexico.

Lieutenant Colonel Baylor issued a proclamation forming the Confederate Territory of Arizona on the first day of August, 1861. A meeting of the pro-Confederate citizens of Mesilla in May 1861 commissioned George M. Frazer to form the Arizona Rangers. This company saw action at the battles at Valverde, Glorieta, Apache Canyon and Peralta.[^52] The Arizona Rangers and the Arizona Guards were mustered into Confederate service for a term of 12-months.[^53]

In July 1861, Henry H. Sibley, an officer who had resigned in May from the US Army at Fort Fillmore, New Mexico, received a commission as a brigadier general. Confederate president Davis authorized him to raise a brigade of volunteers to invade New Mexico.[^54] General Sibley returned to San Antonio and gathered volunteers.[^55]

General Sibley’s brigade, consisting of the 4th, 5th and 7th Texas Mounted Rifles, left San Antonio in October for El Paso on the Lower or Military road.[^56] The intent of the expedition was to join with the men of the 2nd Regiment of Texas Mounted Rifles already in west Texas, expel Federal troops from the New Mexico Territory and possibly annex New Mexico and the Mexican state of Chihuahua to the Confederacy. The ultimate goal was to secure an overland route from Texas to the Pacific coast.[^57]

Mail coaches continued to carry the mail. Rife claimed that he accompanied Sibley’s command into New Mexico. Between October 1861 and May 1862 the 3,200-man brigade left Fort Bliss and traveled up the Rio Grande. 58(14) He apparently continued to work as a conductor on the mail stage during this period. 59(158, pp. 19, 23)

The US Postmaster General discontinued mail service between El Paso and San Antonio on February 17, 1862 but George Giddings, the mail contractor, obtained a Confederate government contract to provide mail services between San Antonio and California. 60(84) (206, p. 85) He realized that Federal troops and Indian troubles might prevent his men from going beyond El Paso 61(82) but he kept the stages running between San Antonio and El Paso until August 1862. 62(206, p. 95)

### The Confederates invaded New Mexico Territory.

In December 1861 General Sibley arrived at Fort Bliss. 63(465, p. 186) (470, p. 21) John Baylor already had 630 men of the 2nd Regiment in seven cavalry companies and two artillery companies in the area. To avoid a probable conflict with Colonel Baylor, General Sibley sent Baylor on a diplomatic mission to Mexico and gave Baylor’s command to Major Charles Pyron .64(285, p. 48) (470, p. 23) General Sibley then claimed all of New Mexico Territory for the Confederacy in a proclamation issued on December 20. 65(149, p. 55)

In the spring of 1862 the Confederates began the invasion of New Mexico. Sibley’s brigade won the first major battle, the Battle of Valverde, on February 20, 1862. 66(581, p. 87) (472, p. 52) The Confederates then advanced up the Rio Grande valley towards the territorial capital. The Federal commander knew that the Texans were critically short of supplies and on March 4 Federal troops removed 120 wagonloads of supplies from Albuquerque and sent them to Fort Union, northeast of Albuquerque. Retreating Federal troops destroyed the remaining supplies in Albuquerque. 67(581, p. 89) On March 7 the Confederate expeditionary force entered Albuquerque and on March 10 it occupied Santa Fé, the territorial capital. 68(470, p. 31) (581, p. 89)

The Federal commander waited for reinforcements. 69(472, p. xiv) On March 11 the 1st Colorado Volunteers from Denver City, Colorado reached Fort Union after traveling 400 miles in 14 days. Union troops and the Colorado volunteers left Fort Union on March 22 and headed south along the Santa Fé Trail to Bernal Springs to meet the Texans. On March 26, 418 Federal troops encountered and captured thirty-two Confederate scouts on the western slope of Glorieta Pass and then clashed with 300 Confederates under Major Pyron in the Battle of Apache Canyon .70(581, p. 92)

At the end of the day, the Federal troops retreated to Pigeon’s Ranch (a stage station on the Santa Fé Trail) and the Confederates camped at Johnson’s Ranch. Twelve inches of snow fell during the night.71(472, p. 85) In the second battle at Glorieta Pass on March 28 both armies were advancing when they encountered each other in a thick pine and cedar forest. By the end of the day the Texans had captured Pigeon’s Ranch.

The fight at Glorieta Pass on March 28 ended in a draw but during the fight the Confederate supply wagon train at Johnson’s Ranch was destroyed. 72(472, p. xviii) (470, p. 32) This loss was a decisive blow to the Texans. 73(285, pg. 48) The Federal troops escaped to Kozlowski’s’s Ranch and the Texans returned to Santa Fé. 74(581, p. 94)

### After the fight at Glorieta Pass the Confederates retreated.

On April 7 the Confederates returned to Albuquerque where their remaining supplies were stored. 75(470, p. 33) On April 13 the Texans left Albuquerque heading south down the Rio Grande valley. They were attacked at Peralta on April 15 and then allowed to escape downriver. 76(472, pp. xix, 119)

The Confederates fared no better in Arizona Territory than they did in northern New Mexico. Confederate troops penetrated to the west of Tucson but abandoned Tucson two weeks prior to the arrival of the California Column. 77(470, p. 362) The California Column of 2,350 men was formed in San Francisco to guard the overland mail from Salt Lake City but was diverted to New Mexico when the Texans launched their invasion. The California Column reached Tucson May 20 and Fort Thorn on the Rio Grande on July 4, 1862. 78(581, pp. 78-9)

### The Confederates evacuated West Texas in 1862.

The remaining Confederate troops began to return to San Antonio in June. 79(285, p. 49) In July and August the half-starved and nearly naked men began arriving in San Antonio .80(224, p. 107) (470, p. 39) (472, p. 125) On July 8  the rearguard of the Confederate Army of New Mexico left Fort Fillmore and, on July 12 abandoned and then burned Fort Bliss. 81(581, p. 98) (470, p. 39) (285, p. 49) Many families from Franklin left for San Antonio with the Confederate troops, leaving the town almost deserted. 82(206, p. 94) In August the last Confederate troops departed Fort Davis and Apache Indians looted and burned the buildings. The last stage from El Paso arrived in San Antonio on August 16,1862. The coachmen found many of the mail stations deserted or destroyed. 83(147, p. 46)

Four days after the Confederates left Fort Davis Union troops occupied Franklin. On August 20 men of the First California Volunteer Calvary took possession of Fort Bliss and the stage line operated by George Giddings suspended all service west of Fort Clark. Fort Clark was the western-most fort garrisoned by Confederate troops and it became the terminus of the mail route. 84(147, p. 48) (206, pp. 95-6)

The Texans of Sibley’s Battalion won every engagement and captured Albuquerque and Santa Fé before retreating back to El Paso. 85(206, p. 93) (80, p. 92) (147, p. 41) However it was apparent that Sibley’s force was inadequate to hold northern New Mexico for the Confederacy and was inadequately supplied. Sibley’s Battalion returned to San Antonio in small groups and the brigade was distributed to different counties in Texas to enroll new recruits. 86(149, p. 55) When CSA Brigadier General J. Bankhead Magruder took command of Texas in November 1862, he used Sibley’s troops from the New Mexico expedition to recapture Galveston Island from the Federal army. 87(80, p. 92) In the spring of 1863 the various units of Sibley’s brigade were reorganized at East Bernard (a station on the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railroad in Wharton County) for service outside Texas. 88(158, p. 41) (149, p. 131)

### West Texas remained a no-man’s land until 1866.

Although Fort Clark was the western-most fort garrisoned by Confederate troops, the 1st California Cavalry patrolled as for as Fort Davis in August 1862. 89(206, p. 95)  In December a Federal patrol went east as far as the Horsehead Crossing of the Pecos to check on rumors that Henry Skillman and 6,000 troops were planning to attack Franklin and Fort Bliss. 90(147, p. 49) The patrol located no Confederates but found that the road was being watched by Apaches. 91(206, p. 95).East of Fort Davis, Kiowa and Comanche raiders attacked as far east as Sabinal Station and during the Civil War the line of white settlement moved east by about three counties as the women and children moved east to escape Indian attacks .92(159, p. 349) (224, p. 156)

After the failure of the Confederate invasion of New Mexico, the Federal commander, US Lieutenant Colonel Edward Canby asked to be reassigned to the Eastern front 93(582, p. 13) and Brigadier General James H. Carleton of the California Column assumed command of Federal troops in New Mexico. General Carleton launched a war against the Navajo, Kiowa and Apache Indians that impoverished them and finally drove them to reservations. 94(581, p. 84) When Carleton learned that the Confederates were preparing another invasion force, he promised a scorched earth campaign and ordered his commanders to prepare to destroy anything of value at San Elizario, Ysleta, Socorro, Fort Bliss, Franklin and Hart’s Mill should the Confederates advance on the area. 95(260, p. 110)

## Vicksburg Campaign, 1862-1863   

*“...thence he passed to Mississippi and was wounded at Deer Creek near Vicksburg”.., “Custodian of the Alamo”, San Antonio Light, February 23, 1887.*

### Vicksburg was the key to control of the Mississippi River.

Control of the Mississippi River was of great strategic importance to the governments of both the United and the Confederate States. 96(807, p. 93) (644, pp. 12, 39) The side that controlled the Mississippi River would likely emerge as the victor in the War Between the States. Early in the War the city of Vicksburg was identified as the key to control of the Mississippi and in January 1863 the US military began a campaign to wrest control of the city, and the river, from the Confederacy. 97(647, p. 118) (644, p. 60) In 1863 the Mississippi Delta was a swamp except for the natural levees along the waterways. Numerous plantations were located on narrow strips of dry land bordering the levees 98(646, p. 479) and the Delta was one of the richest agricultural areas of Mississippi. It was home to a large population of Negro slaves and their white overseers. 99(643, p. 184)

In the early months of the Civil War Confederate authorities discouraged enlistment of troops in Texas, thinking that the war would be over quickly and that they would not be needed. Nevertheless a number of companies formed and left the state where they were integrated into various regiments. 100(80, p. 90) (341, p. 590) Several units went to Mississippi and helped in the defense of Vicksburg .101(149, pp. 65, 131)

Rife was last observed in the upper Rio Grande Valley in July 1861 and he stated that he accompanied the Confederate troops that invaded the Territory of New Mexico. 102(14) These troops did not leave the region until August 1862. 103(206, p. 95) Rife also stated that he was wounded at Deer Creek in the Mississippi Delta but he did not say when. Because we lack definite information about how Rife came to be wounded at Deer Creek, we will describe the activities of military units that were active in the area between August 1862, when the Confederate campaign in New Mexico ended and October 1863 when Rife returned to Texas.

### Thomas Rife accompanied Waul’s Texas Legion to Mississippi in October 1862.

Waul’s Texas Legion was one of the Texas units that participated in the Vicksburg campaign. The Legion was formed in Brenham, Texas on May 13, 1862 three months after Texas seceded from the Union. There were about 2,000 men on the rolls of Waul’s Legion when it was organized. While the known rooster contains 1,350 names, the identities of about 650 men are as yet unknown. 104(469, p. 119)

Waul’s Legion trained  at Camp Waul, at Gay Hill in Washington County, a few miles north of Brenham. The unit camped there throughout the summer and left for Mississippi in August 1862.
When the Civil War began in 1861 mail service between Texas and points west was curtailed. The mail contractor was left with a fleet of wagons and mules that he disposed off as best he could. Rife apparently purchased or received at least one wagon from George Giddings and returned to Brenham where he had first lived when he came to Texas in 1842. In the summer of 1862 Rife apparently hired his services as a freighter or wagon master to Waul’s Texas Legion at Camp Waul where he received $11.00 for 10 rolls of rope and two mule harnesses on September 30. 105(969)

The Legion first went to Holly Springs, Mississippi. Rife accompanied the Legion to Mississippi, probably driving a wagon. There, on October 2 he sold a wagon, four sets of harness and three mules to the army for the sum of one thousand dollars. 106(969)
The Legion was dispatched to Grenada, Mississippi arriving there in January 1863 where the Cavalry Battalion was detached and sent to Vicksburg. The infantry and artillery were sent to Fort Pemberton, in the Mississippi Delta, arriving there in February 1863. 107(469, p. 116) Rife may have accompanied the army to Fort Pemberton.   

### The Lake Providence Expedition, January to March 1863.

During 1863 Federal troops searched for a way to by-pass Confederate batteries at Port Hudson, Port Gibson and Vicksburg that blocked the passage of Federal shipping on the Mississippi River. 108(581, pp. 314-5, 365) Compared to the Confederate government, the Federal government seemed to have unlimited manpower and resources and General U. S. Grant, the Federal commander of the Vicksburg campaign, adopted any suggestion that had even the slightest chance of silencing the Confederate guns at Vicksburg. 109(644, pp. 60-3)

One such suggestion led to what was known as the Lake Providence Expedition. The plan was to make a canal through Lake Providence to the Ouachita River that in turn flowed to the Red River. The Red River emptied into the Mississippi River at Port Hudson, 100 miles south of Vicksburg. 110(647, p. 107) A canal would allow Grant’s army to move troops south of Vicksburg where they could affect a landing on the east bank of the Mississippi River.

Beginning in January 1863, 1,000 Federal soldiers dug a canal upstream of Vicksburg on the Louisiana side to connect the Mississippi River with Lake Providence. 111(647, p. 93) When the canal was completed and opened, the bayous connecting Lake Providence to the Red River flooded. 112(646, p. 478) (647, p. 92) A steamboat then attempted, without success, to find a route between Lake Providence and the Red River in order to by-pass Shreveport as well as Vicksburg. 113(601, p. 58) Trees growing in Baxter Bayou blocked passage of Grant’s transports and the attempt was abandoned by the end of the March.

### The Yazoo Pass Expedition of February to April 1863 failed.

East of the Mississippi River are a number of streams, running roughly parallel to the Mississippi River, that drain the Mississippi Delta. These rivers and creeks all discharge into the Yazoo River. The Yazoo River then joins the Mississippi River just north of Vicksburg. Between January and April 1863 the US Navy and Army cooperated in various unsuccessful attempts to use these waterways to outflank Confederate defenses at Vicksburg. 114(646, p. 482) (581, pp. 364-8)

An effort was made to land an invasion force on the Mississippi side of the river north of Vicksburg in February 1863.  The Mississippi River levee at Yazoo Pass was breeched to prepare for the Yazoo Pass Expedition .115(601, p. 60) (644, p. 69) This flooded the entire region to a depth of 8 ½ feet. 116(647, p. 110) (646, p. 485) On March 2, 1863 Federal gunboats entered Coldwater River and on March 10 ten US Navy gunboats and troop transports reached a Confederate battery that blocked further passage. The battery, called Fort Pemberton, was still under construction. 117(647, p. 111) (646, p. 506) Fort Pemberton was built of cotton bales covered in sand and earth. A steamboat (the “Star of the West”) was sunk near the fort to block the river and Waul’s Texas Legion and three infantry regiments were placed there to defend it. .118(646, p. 507) (647, p. 114)

On March 11 and 13 Federal gunboats twice attacked Fort Pemberton but were driven off. 119(643, p. 189) (647, pp. 111-5) The narrowness of the channel in front of the fort did not allow the Federal gunboats to turn sideways so their guns could not be used effectively 120(644, pp. 70-1) and the US Army could not land troops because of the swampy terrain.

Fort Pemberton blocked the progress of the Federal gunboats for three weeks and prevented them from reaching Snyder’s Bluff 121(581, p. 365) (469, p. 19) where their troops could be landed. Reluctantly General Grant abandoned the Yazoo Pass campaign and focused his attention elsewhere .122(643, p. 189)

### The Steele’s Bayou Expedition of March 1863 also failed.

Beginning on March 14, 1863 another attempt was made to attack Vicksburg from the north. The Steele’s Bayou Expedition left the Mississippi River with the intention of travelling up the Yazoo River, Steele’s Bayou, Black Bayou, Deer Creek, Rolling Fork and Big Sunflower River so troops could be landed upstream of Hayne’s and Snyder’s bluffs overlooking the Yazoo River and downstream of Fort Pemberton.

The Expedition began when five ironclads (referred to as “turtles”), four tugs and two mortar boats left the Mississippi River at Young’s Point and traveled up the Yazoo River to Steele’s Bayou. 123(647, p. 119) At Deer Creek they turned north toward the Little Sunflower River.

The Expedition traveled through a heavily populated area with many plantations located on the natural levees that lined Deer Creek. 124(644, p. 72) The white inhabitants of the plantations fled at the approach of the ironclads, going east across the Tallahatchie River, while hundreds of black slaves lined the banks to see the huge ships traveling the narrow waterways. 125(646, pp. 554-5) Residents along the route hid their livestock and burned stores of cotton as the ironclads passed by, crashing into and destroying bridges and uprooting trees as they went. The ironclads used in the Steele’s Bayou Expedition were each 175 feet long and 51 feet wide and carried a crew of 251 men.126(644, p. 96)

By March 18 the ironclads were within seven miles of Rolling Fork on the Little Sunflower River. 127(646, p. 556) Willow trees growing in Deer Creek slowed the gunboats leading the flotilla to a crawl.

On March 17 Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Ferguson’s brigade of Confederates were camped at Fall’s Plantation when they learned of the approaching Federal flotilla. Captain George Barnes started overland with the cavalry for Rolling Fork and the infantry and artillery embarked on a steamboat to be transported there. On March 19 at 4pm Ferguson’s Confederate troops arrived at the junction of Rolling Fork and Little Sunflower River only to find the road flooded. 128(646, p. 561)

### The Federal gunboats became stalled on Deer Creek.

Upon arriving at the junction of Rolling Fork and Deer Creek, Colonel Ferguson impressed slaves to cut trees to block the channel in front of the Woodfork plantation. White overseers from nearby plantations led the gangs of Negroes to cut trees growing on the banks of the flooded waterway. 129(647, p. 122) After traversing most of Deer Creek, the gunboats found that willow trees growing in and along the streambed near the L. C. Watson plantation blocked their passage forward. 130(646, p. 555) Rear Admiral David D. Porter, the commander of the US Navy’s Mississippi River Squadron directed three hundred sailors to leave the gunboats to prevent Confederates from approaching the stalled ships. 131(644, p. 74) These men mounted a battery on a nearby Indian mound .132(643, p. 186)

That same day Colonel Ferguson sent the Arkansas regiment and his artillery to attack Federal patrols guarding the gunboats. The Confederates dislodged the battery on the Indian mound but were driven off by fire from the gunboats. 133(643, p. 186) Admiral Porter, aware of his danger, paid a slave from a nearby plantation to carry a message through Confederate lines to General Sherman asking for re-enforcements.134(646, p. 559) (643, p. 186)

The next day, March 21, 1863, Ferguson’s Confederate cavalry, led by Captain Barnes moved down the creek and began felling trees across the stream, effectively trapping the gun boats. The Federal gunboats tried to escape by drifting backwards, bouncing from bank to bank since they could not steer backwards and could not turn around in the narrow waterway. 135(643, p. 187) Admiral Porter prepared to abandon and scuttle the ships if necessary. However the Confederates were slow in mounting their attack and instead spent the time sniping at Union work parties trying to clear the channel. 136(646, p. 566) They were unaware that Federal reinforcements were rapidly approaching from the south.

### Union infantry rescued the trapped gunboats on Deer Creek.

At 3pm the 8th Missouri regiment of US infantry (Giles Smith’s) reached Dr. Moore’s plantation, drove the snipers away and rescued the trapped boats. 137(646, p. 570) General Smith also rounded up all black males that he encountered to keep the Confederates from using them to cut trees to block the waterway. 138(643, p. 187) By midnight work parties from the trapped boats had cleared the channel and on March 22 the boats backed away with Smith’s men moving along both sides of the bank to keep Confederate snipers at bay. 139(644, p. 74) (646, p. 570)

Meanwhile US General William T. Sherman led the remaining US infantry on a march by candlelight through the night of March 21. 140(643, p. 188) Sherman’s force reached the ironclads just as the Confederates mounted an assault. 141(646, p. 577) As a result, the Confederates were driven back before they could mount a decisive attack on the gunboats. The Confederates withdrew to Rolling Fork and the gunboats continued to back down Deer Creek, reaching the Mississippi River a week later. 142(644, p. 75) (581, p. 367)

No Texas units participated in the action at Deer Creek. During this campaign Waul’s Texas Legion and the 2nd Texas Regiment remained at Fort Pemberton. If Rife was wounded at Deer Creek as he said he was, he may have been engaged as a partisan operating outside of military control or as a volunteer with the home guard or one of the Mississippi units that participated in the campaign. He had good reason to be in the area. His sister and brother-in-law, Lawrence Wade owned a 350-acre plantation, called Wade Lawn on the Mississippi side of the river only a dozen or so miles from Deer Creek and Rolling Fork. It backed up to a swamp that drained into Steele’s Bayou .143(704)

### Waul’s Legion was captured at Vicksburg.

In April 1863 Waul’s infantry and artillery were moved six miles from Fort Pemberton to Point Leflore at the junction of three rivers (Tallahatchie, Yalobusha and Yazoo) two miles northwest of the town of Greenwood. 144(469, p. 20) In May 1863 two companies of Waul’s Legion infantry were sent to Yazoo City, the location of a large Confederate navy yard. They were surprised and captured in July and sent to a prison camp in Indiana. Most of Waul’s Legion retreated to Vicksburg where they were forced to surrender in July along with the rest of Confederate General Pemberton’s besieged army. The men of Waul’s Legion were paroled in August and September 1863 and reorganized at Houston in October and November. 145(469, p. 56)

In July 1864, over a year after the surrender of Vicksburg, the Vicksburg parolees were exchanged and allowed to return to active service. After crops were harvested in the late summer of 1864 and news of the exchange circulated among the paroled soldiers, soldiers began to straggle back to their regiments. However most units never returned to their full strength. Disease and enemy fire had killed up to one-third of the men during the Vicksburg campaign. Some men joined other units and a few never reported back. Many had joined local militia units to support Confederate troops near their homes. If captured, while in violation of their parole, they falsely identified their regiment to avoid being interned for breaking parole. 146(645, p. 263)

### Confederate soldiers were cared for in hospitals.

If Thomas Rife was wounded at Deer Creek in 1863 while in military service he would have been sent to a regimental or field hospital nearby. Confederate army military hospitals kept extensive records of wounded and sick soldiers. 147(479, p. 26) Most Confederate military hospital records were lost. By the time the collection, purchase and compilation of Confederate records began in 1878 many hospital records were already destroyed. A few were taken home and retained by the officer in charge of the hospital but this was the exception rather than the rule 148(480, pp. 163, 179) and few such records are known to exist.


## 36th Regiment, Texas Cavalry, 1863-1865

 “After the latter place had fallen before federal arms, Rife joined Captain Lytle’s company in Wood’s regiment where he served some time”, “Custodian of the Alamo,” San Antonio Light, February 23, 1887.

*“After the latter place had fallen before federal arms, Rife joined Captain Lytle’s company in Wood’s regiment where he served some time”, “Custodian of the Alamo,” San Antonio Light, February 23, 1887.*

### Many Texans expected a short war.

After the ordinance of secession was ratified in a statewide plebiscite in February 1861, 149(80, p. 85), many Texans, not wishing to miss what was expected to be a short war, 150(341, p. 590) (780, p. 30) formed companies and left Texas to join regiments in other states. 151(80 p. 90) (341, p. 590) A few months later, the Texas Legislature, realizing that the war would not be over as quickly as some had initially hoped, passed a law conscripting men for military service .152(72, p. 141) In April 1862 the Confederate Congress also passed a conscription law that drafted most men 18 to 35 years old for three-years of service. 153(580, p. 101) (636, p. 265)

Thomas Rife was born in 1823 and was over 35 years-of-age in 1861. 154(574) Although he was exempt from the Confederate draft he was still liable for military service in the state militia. In Texas all men 18 to 50 years old were required to enroll in the state militia. 155(580, p. 136) However Rife left Texas in late 1862, apparently as a wagoner for Waul’s Legion, 156(969) and was subsequently wounded at Deer Creek near Vicksburg in March or April 1863.

There is no evidence that Rife enrolled in a military unit that served in Mississippi. If he did serve in a Confederate unit in Mississippi he did not go to Vicksburg after being wounded at Deer Creek. His name does not appear on the roll of men captured and paroled at Vicksburg. There is, of course, the possibility that he escaped capture at Vicksburg by fleeing across the Mississippi River. Another possibility is that he was attached to a unit that was not captured at Vicksburg. This seems unlikely because most such units continued in service until the War’s end. After he was wounded he may have been taken to a hospital, treated and subsequently furloughed. He may have recovered from his injury at his sister’s house nearby. Details of what Rife did in Mississippi in late 1862 and early 1863 are lacking. There is no doubt that by October of 1863 he had returned to Texas.

### Thomas Rife enlisted in Col. Peter Wood’s Regiment.

In October 1863 Rife enlisted in Captain Samuel Lytle’s Company (Company H), 36th Regiment (Colonel Peter Wood’s), Texas Cavalry at San Antonio. He enlisted for the duration of the war. 157(101) (14) Samuel Lytle and Rife were longtime friends, having met in 1842 at Washington-on-the-Brazos as young men 158(575) and having lived as neighbors west of Castroville.

The 36th Regiment, Texas Cavalry was organized in March 1862 and then assigned to patrol Fredericksburg. German settlers living northwest of San Antonio were not slaveholders and supported the Union throughout the Civil War. For that reason Fredericksburg was considered a Unionist stronghold that needed to be watched by the Confederate military. At a later date, Wood’s regiment was stationed along the Texas Gulf coast and along the lower Rio Grande. 159(677) In June 1863 the regiment moved to Indianola where it remained until February 1864 when it was dismounted and sent to Louisiana for the Red River Campaign that lasted from March 10 to May 22, 1864. 160(1005)
Although he continued to be listed on the regiments muster rolls, 161(130, p. 168) he was detached for service in West Texas in November 1863 162(17) and did not return until late 1864 or 1865. 163(101)

## Capt. Skillman’s Spy Company, 1863-1865

*“...when by special request of Capt. Henry Skillman who knew his knowledge and worth, he was detailed by Gen. McGruder for scout service on Skillman’s border scouts. He was with the party when it was surprised by thirty-five federals of the California column at midnight. All was asleep, the sentinels were taken, and the party fired on in their beds. Skillman was then killed, and nearly all the party exterminated. Rife was seriously wounded then, two ribs were broken, and one of them has not re-united to this day thereby incapacitating him from heavy work. He was left for dead on the field, but recovered. Then the citizens of Presidio del Norte knowing him and appreciating his services, recommended him to succeed Skillman”, “Custodian of the Alamo,” San Antonio Light, February 23, 1887.*

### Henry Skillman was an employee of George Giddings.

When George Giddings was awarded a contract to deliver the mail to California in 1854, he hired Henry Skillman who had previously carried the mail. Skillman continued in the employ of Giddings until 1861. It was Skillman who carried the last southbound mail from Santa Fé to Mesilla before the Civil War closed the route .164(138, p. 180)

When the Civil War began, Skillman, a native of New Jersey but a long-time resident of the upper Rio Grande Valley, cast his lot with the Confederacy even though he was not a secessionist. Confederates under Colonel John R. Baylor had recently captured Fort Fillmore and Skillman became the sutler there. (A sutler was a civilian who had the concession to operate a retail store on or near a military base).

In October 1861 George Giddings, Skillman’s long-time employer, obtained a contract from the Confederate Government to carry the mail between Mesilla in New Mexico Territory and San Antonio. By then the southern part of New Mexico Territory had been reorganized as the Confederate Territory of Arizona. 165(202, p. 39) Henry Skillman became one of Giddings’ conductors and carried the mail between Mesilla and El Paso. 166(411, p. 121) (775)

### Henry Skillman stayed in West Texas.

Skillman stayed behind in West Texas after Sibley’s army returned to San Antonio. 167(206, p. 97) Upon the arrival of Union troops in August 1862, a group of 100 or so Confederate sympathizers fled across the Rio Grande and took refuge in the Mexican town of El Paso del Norte. 168(285, p. 49, 87) There they continued to hold out hope that the Confederacy would reoccupy West Texas. Before 1851, when he became involved in carrying the mails, Skillman had operated a private courier service. With the mail service disrupted, Skillman once again operated a courier service between the upper Rio Grande Valley and San Antonio and California. He had no official contract to carry mail and had no hope of compensation from the Confederate Government. 169(138, p. 190)

Skillman’s reputation as a leader of men sparked rumors about the role he intended to play in Confederate Arizona. The first of many rumors that circulated about Skillman’s intentions appeared in the Mesilla Times newspaper on October 12, 1861 when it was reported that he was raising a company to attack “Abe’s men, Apaches, or what not.” The handpicked men apparently didn’t want pay, “only the property they can take from the Indians.” 170(260, p. 109)

Later Skillman and his “handpicked men” were incorporated into a military organization of scouts and spies along the western border of Texas. The Southern sympathizers in El Paso del Norte, across the river from Union-held Fort Bliss, were a valuable source of information on activities of the Union Army and Skillman became the conduit of this information to military authorities in San Antonio. 171(773) Documents later found in Skillman’s possession indicated that he was part of a covert network of spies and couriers linking Confederate sympathizers in California to Confederate military authorities in Texas. 172(206, p. 97)

Skillman also played a role in a campaign of misinformation designed to keep Federal authorities off balance. Skillman appears to have helped spread rumors that Confederate troops were returning the West Texas. On August 23, 1861, three days after arriving at Fort Bliss, a detachment of the 1st California Cavalry scouted eastward to Fort Davis and found that the West Texas forts were not occupied. 173(206, p. 95) The Rebels had, at least for the moment, abandoned the area. Yet the Federal troops in New Mexico and El Paso couldn’t be sure that they would not return in force. In November 18, 1862, US Army Headquarters Department of New Mexico received a report of rumors that 6,000 Confederate troops were on the way to attack the upper Rio Grande Valley once again. 174(534, p. 605)

In November Skillman established a camp near the Mexican town of Presidio del Norte (now Ojinaga, Chihuahua) and kept Federal commanders agitated by fear of an imminent invasion. In response, the US Army dispatched scouts down the Pecos River from Fort Stanton, New Mexico to as far as Horsehead Crossing to investigate. A party was sent from Ft. Bliss along the Butterfield Road north to Huerco Tanks and Pope’s Crossing on the Pecos River. A third party traveled along the Lower Military Road through Quitman Canyon and Eagle Springs to as far as Fort Davis 175(260, p. 111) According to a rumor reported to the Federal commander, Henry Skillman and John Stevenson were said to be in Franklin on November 25, 1862 and had a company of men at Presidio del Norte that would attack El Paso, Texas in six days. 176(534, p. 607)

### Federal commanders in New Mexico feared a second invasion.

In preparation for the expected Confederate invasion, US General Joseph Rodman West ordered Companies D and K of the California Column under Major William McMullen to the Rio Grande in December 1862. 177(260, p. 110) West expected Skillman to establish a base below El Paso for the purpose of opening communications with Chihuahua in order to procure supplies for a large force of Confederates advancing up the Pecos River. 178(260, p. 111) (534, p. 606)

In March 1863 Federal authorities received word from Reuben W. Creel, a merchant in Chihuahua City who was also acting as a Union agent, that Skillman had a company of rangers in Presidio del Norte and that an officer named Woods and his troops were at Comanche Springs .179(534, p. 377) It was reported that Skillman’s party of 25 men and one wagon left Presidio del Norte in March for Arizona, having hired some Pueblo Indians as guides. Afterwards it was reported that he was at Cibolo Ranch, ten leagues upstream of Presidio del Norte .180(534, p. 426)

Creel reported that he suspected that Skillman’s activities were an attempt to secure the road from San Antonio to Chihuahua. 181(260, p. 113) While it was clear that none of the Federal commanders knew where the spy company was or what they were doing, 182(407), Creel who had lived in Chihuahua for many years, may have correctly guessed the intentions of Confederate authorities. 183(534, p. 426)

### In the fall of 1863 the Federal army invaded the Texas Gulf Coast.

In June 1863 the war in the east was going well for the Confederacy. Confederate General Robert E. Lee defeated a Union army at Chancellorsville in early May and then launched an invasion of Pennsylvania with an army of 75,000 men.

US authorities in New Mexico watched apprehensively as French troops drove Mexican President Benito Juarez from Mexico City in 1863 and then pursued him and his forces into Chihuahua 184(188, p. 88). French imperial forces, who were natural allies of the Confederacy, appeared to be gaining strength in Mexico. In 1864 French military officers took control of Mexican towns along the lower Rio Grande .185(582, p. 24) (780, p. 210) With the French military in control of the lower Rio Grande valley the way would be open to flood the Confederacy with the military supplies it desperately needed. 186(582, p. 12) (780, p. 114) General McGruder of Texas organized a force to be ready, if peace should appear imminent, to “take possession of New Mexico and Arizona…so that at the termination of the war they may be ours.” 187(534, p. 62)

In the early months of 1863 the outcome of the War was uncertain and many in the South believed that victory was possible. Then in July 1863 news reached Texas of the surrender of the Confederate redoubt at Vicksburg and General Robert E. Lee’s defeat at Gettysburg. Even after those decisive defeats the French threat remained and Union commanders moved to occupy the Rio Grande Valley to prevent the French from shipping much needed war supplies to Texas.

In September 1863 a small Confederate battery at Sabine Pass on the Louisiana state line famously fought off a Federal invasion of east Texas. 188(80, p. 95) A few months later, on November 23, 1863 Confederate military authorities learned that another Federal invasion force had appeared off the Gulf Coast on November 16 at Corpus Christi. 189(101) Federal troops were put ashore and captured Corpus Christi, Aransas Pass, Indianola and Brownsville. The US troops that landed near Brownsville soon controlled a large part of the lower Rio Grande Valley as far upstream as Rio Grande City.

A few months later the US Army withdrew many of their 6,000 troops in the Valley to pursue the Red River campaign. 190(149, p. 120) (80, p. 96) However about 3,500 Federal soldiers were left at Fort Brown, Ringgold Barracks and other places to obstruct commerce with Mexico and prevent the French from shipping war material to Texas. 191(149, p. 120) Federal commanders had orders to intercept the Texas cotton trade with Mexico 192(149, p. 119) and to prevent an alliance between the French army in Mexico and the Confederates in Texas. 193(780, p. 250)  

The landing of US troops in Texas in November 1863 was proof that the State’s favorable geographic position would not protect it from an invasion. Confederate authorities had supposed that the western frontier and Indian Territory could not support an invading army and that sandbars along the Gulf Coast would prevent the entry of large vessels or gunboats. 194(149, pg. 65) Not fearing invasion from the west, Confederate troops had abandoned all forts in west Texas. Only Fort Clark was garrisoned to block Federal troops from invading along the San Antonio-El Paso Road 195(17) and forts were built along the Gulf Coast to block entry into the few landing points that could be used by an invading force. 196(780, p. 204)

Now, with two Federal armies on the Rio Grande the Confederates assumed a defensive posture 197(260, p. 117) and the services of Skillman’s spy company were needed even more than before. After the Federal invasion of the Gulf Coast, Confederate authorities strengthened their surveillance of the western approaches to San Antonio. They feared that the US Army could send a land force from New Mexico Territory to cooperate with an invasion along the Gulf Coast. 198(780, pp. 91-2, 119)

In response to the Federal occupation of the lower Rio Grande Valley, the Texans shifted the large cross-border trade in cotton upriver above Laredo. 199(159, p. 355) (218, p. 131) Supplies purchased in Matamoros were freighted to San Antonio via Eagle Pass to avoid Federal troops. 200(159, p. 342) (431, p. 22) Confederate authorities in San Antonio must have been preparing for the complete loss of their trade routes between San Antonio and Mexico through the lower Rio Grande Valley when they instructed Skillman to reconnoiter the road to Presidio del Norte.

When word of the Federal invasion of the Texas Gulf Coast reached San Antonio on November 23, 1863 Rife was not with his company but was on sick leave in San Antonio. 201(101) During the emergency caused by the Federal invasion, Colonel Dickinson, the Confederate commander in San Antonio, assigned Rife to scout the Lower El Paso Road between Fort Clark and Comanche Springs (Fort Stockton) and report on the movement of Union Troops. Rife led a detachment of six men, all of who were exempts (meaning that they were not eligible for the draft, probably because they were overage). Rife was directed to maintain communications with Henry Skillman who was watching the Upper Road to prevent either party from being cut off. In his report to headquarters in San Antonio, Major Andrew Dickinson referred to Rife as an “old frontiersman.” 202(17) While Rife was 40-years old, Dickenson was referring to Rife’s many years of experience in West Texas rather than his actual age. Colonel Dickinson knew that many of Rife’s peers had not lived for 25 years, as he had, on the edge of civilization.

### Henry Skillman commanded a spy company.

On November 17, 1863 Roy Bean, a Confederate sympathizer from California, recruited twenty mounted men in San Antonio who were willing to serve in “a spy company to range upon this frontier”. These men were probably part of a large group of exiled Confederates from New Mexico and Arizona who had taken up residence in San Antonio. 203(817, p. 57) He applied to Colonel A. D. Dickinson, the Confederate commander at San Antonio, for a commission to enter into this service. 204(17)

Roy Bean may not have known that a company of scouts or spies had been operating on the western frontier for some time. 205(957) After November 1863 Skillman’s company was strengthened and reorganized. In official communications between Confederate authorities such as Colonel John Ford, Skillman was now referred to as “Captain” 206(260, p. 109) (534, p. 1033) perhaps reflecting the fact that his courier service had, in fact, evolved into a military organization. Even if he had not done so before, by February 1864 Skillman was reporting to Colonel John S. Ford who commanded the 2nd Regiment, Texas Mounted Rifles. 207(101)

### Thomas Rife was assigned to Capt. Skillman’s company of scouts.

On February 4, 1864 Colonel Ford, commanding Confederate expeditionary forces on the lower Rio Grande, received a letter from Henry Skillman requesting that Tom Rife be assigned to his Spy Company. Skillman said, “Before I can start for the upper country I must recruit men suited for the kind of duty I will have to perform… I must have not only good men but good frontiersmen.” 208(101) The request was forwarded to General Wood, Rife’s regimental commander, and then to Captain Sam Lytle, Rife’s company commander.

The 2nd Lieutenant of Company H, John K. Minder, offered his recommendation in regards to Rife’s qualifications in a letter to Brigadier General P. C. Wood on February 12, 1864. Lieutenant Minder thought that Rife was “qualified in every way for that kind of service from his perfect knowledge of the upper country (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California) and possessing the qualities of a true soldier.” Rife had been detached from the 36th Regiment since November 1863 and was now formally assigned to the spy company as of February 16, 1864. In March 1864 his records indicated that his pay was still due from the date of his enlistment, his horse was valued at $150 and his equipment was valued at $40. 209(101)

It is not clear what Skillman’s orders were, but in March 1864 his men helped the Confederate military map the best route for the movement of troops from San Antonio to El Paso. 210(613, wrong number) In late February or early March Skillman and his men rode from San Antonio heading west. On March 9, 1864 Colonel John Ford reported that Captain Skillman had “gone above,” i.e. up river. Other units under Ford’s command were deployed to oppose the Federal force advancing up the Rio Grande from Brownsville. 211(534, p. 1033)

### Federal troops attacked Skillman’s company.

Although the threat of an invasion of New Mexico by the Confederates had evaporated, the Federal commander in New Mexico was determined to be rid of Skillman. On April 3, 1864, Captain Albert H. French, a man familiar with West Texas and New Mexico, set out from San Elizário with 25 men of Company A of the California Column with pack mules carrying twenty days of supplies. He had orders to capture or kill Skillman and his company of spies. The party passed abandoned Fort Quitman and proceeded to Eagle Springs, Van Horn’s Well, Dead Man’s Hole, Barrell Springs, Fort Davis and hence down to the Rio Grande along the old Salt Road. On April 14 at Cottonwood Springs the men, by chance and good fortune, found an inscription carved on a tree indicating that Skillman had arrived there on the 3rd. Realizing that Skillman was probably still in the vicinity, Captain French sent scouts ahead to find Skillman’s camp. They chanced upon Skillman’s camp 6 miles away at Spenser’s Ranch, one mile downstream of the present town of Presidio, Texas on the old Fortin Road near the river crossing. 212(467, p. 151) Skillman was unaware of the presence of the Federal soldiers.

Captain French planned to attack the camp after the Confederates were asleep and waited until after midnight to begin his approach. After walking and crawling for an hour the attack party reached Skillman’s camp at 1:30 am on April 15, 1864. After the order to surrender was given, a few moments of fighting ensued. According to Captain French’s report 213(261), two men, including Skillman, were killed outright; two (including Rife) were mortally wounded; four prisoners were taken and two men escaped across the river. Captain French and his captives arrived back at Fort Quitman on April 22, 1864. 214(262, p. 199-201) (534, vol. 34, p. 880)

In his report, Captain French listed the other members of Skillman’s unit. They were (Jarvis) Hubble, (George) Clown (Garner), (Tom) Rife, McMullen, (William) Ford, Thimble, Coburn, Hoover, and Allan. The men who escaped were William Ford (who was guarding the horses) and Thimble (who crawled away into the brush). 215(261)

Rife survived and was taken to Presidio del Norte and cared for by Confederate sympathizers. He was shot in the chest and suffered two broken ribs. According to Rife, the Confederates in Presidio del Norte later nominated him to take Skillman’s place, perhaps as a courier between them and San Antonio or as a spy 216(14). Rife apparently remained in Presidio del Norte while his wounds healed. He never fully recovered from this wound and was unable to do physical work thereafter. 217(681) Almost a year later, on March 1865, Rife was still on the rolls of Company H, 32th Regiment, Texas Cavalry and listed as on detached service with Major Skillman’s scout company. It is not known whether or not the spy company was rebuilt after Skillman’s death and what role, if any, Rife played in it.
Over 100 years later gravediggers at the Catholic Church in Presidio, found “a huge skeleton …with blond hair and a long blond beard” Locals believe that these were the remains of Henry Skillman. 218(262, p. 356, note 60)

### Confederate soldiers in Texas were paroled after the surrender.

In March 1865 word of the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and other Confederate units east of the Mississippi reached Confederate troops in Texas. The soldiers began to leave their camps for home in late May. On the 26th of May Confederate military commanders traveled to Galveston to sign a paper providing “for acts of war on the part of the troops to cease” 219(582, p. 13). Most of the men of the Confederate army in Texas did not wait for surrender papers to be signed and were no longer with their units at the time of surrender. Consequently they were not paroled. To remedy this deficiency, places were appointed where Confederate soldiers could be paroled, superintended by Federal Officers. 220(149, p. 140)

Rife remained on the rolls of Company H on detached service until at least until March 1865, shortly before the unit disbanded. Most men of Company H were from San Antonio and were paroled there in August 1865. Captain Samuel Lytle, who commanded Company H, was paroled in San Antonio on August 18, 1865 221(677). A few days later, on August 22, 1865, Rife surrendered to Federal authorities in San Antonio and was paroled 222(101).

Paroled Confederates were required to sign an oath, called the Amnesty Oath, before receiving their parole. A few individuals, such as men who had been Federal postmasters and mail contractors before the War, were not eligible for the amnesty and could not take the oath. 223(781, pp. i-iii) Rife took the oath as required since he was not included in the classes of persons who were not allowed the benefits of parole. 224(418) The Amnesty Oath required ex-Confederates to swear allegiance to the US Constitution and its laws and to accept the fact that the slaves were free. 225(636, p. 258) The oath that Rife and his compatriots signed read as follows:

“I do solemnly swear (or affirm), in the presence of Almighty God, that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and the Union of the States there under; and that I will, in like manner, abide by and faithfully support all laws and proclamations which have been made during the existing rebellion with reference to the emancipation of slaves, So help me God.” 226(70, p. 35) (218, p. 175)

Hundreds of men who could not or would not sign the oath fled to Mexico and points south 227(581, p. 313) (601, p. 112). The Houston Tri-Weekly Telegraph edition of June 30, 1865 stated “Our city, for the last week or more, has been full of persons on their way to Mexico, to escape arrest by the United States authorities. Among the number are Governor Murrah, Ex-Governors Moore and Allen, of Louisiana, Generals Kirby Smith, Price, Magruder and Shelby. The last is accompanied with about 300 men of his former command.” 228(1412)
