# Appendix: The Widow Rife and her Children, 1895-1900

subheading:  background

Francisca Eduarda Saenz y Cobos was from an old Chihuahua family. She was born October 18, 1854 in Parral, Chihuahua, Mexico. Her parents were Mauricio Saenz and Andre Cobos.[^1]

Prior to 1660, the ancestors of Eduarda Saenz settled in the Valley of San Bartolomé, Mexico.  They were artists or farmers who raised wheat and cattle that were sold to workers in the nearby gold and silver mines. The indigenous people worked the ranches as either slaves or paid employees. In 1770, a thirty-year war between the Apache indians and the settlers began but the farmers of San Bartolomé were largely sheltered from the wars. By 1779, there were seventeen Saenz families living in the village of San Bartolomé.

The Indians were at peace between 1810 until 1831 and, during this period of peace, the region prospered. Chihuahua was unaffected by the Mexican war of independence and paid no attention to the insurrection of Miguel Hidalgo. However, the expulsion of the Spanish mine owners in 1827 and 1829 closed many mines and the new government announced a commercial blockade of North Americans and their merchandise. Cross-border trade came to a halt. The Spanish missions were leaderless, provincial troops were unpaid and taxes were uncollectable.

After 1822, the Comanche Indians and the Spanish settlers began a war of extermination in 1831 and the Apaches rebelled again. This war with the Indians lasted fifty years. Mines in the nearby towns of Parral and Santa Bárbara were closed or curtailed. All men were placed under arms and required to attend weekly drills. Deserters were killed and men who did not answer roll call were sentenced to ten years service on the frontier.

In 1845, the same year that the parents of Eduarda Saenz were married, civil war broke out in Chihuahua between liberals and conservatives. US troops from Missouri invaded Chihuahua from the north in 1846. The residents of Chihuahua were fighting against two sets of invaders, troops from North America and the Apache raiders.

After the Mexican War, commerce with El Paso declined. High tariffs raised the cost of trade goods and impoverished the region’s inhabitants. Indians continued to cross the international border to raid Chihuahua; small towns were militarized to protect themselves. Many farm workers migrated to Durango where it was safer or to the United States where the economy was better. In 1854, when Eduarda Saenz was baptized in San José Church in Parral, thousands of Mexicans crossed the Rio Grande to live on the American side.

The decline in cross-border trade caused by the Indian raids and high tariffs weakened the economy of Chihuahua. Many mines closed and by 1861, the parents of Eduarda Saenz had left the Valley of San Bartolomé and moved north to Camargo City. They continued to move north and apparently were living near El Paso prior to 1871. They were not in San Bartolomé when the town was burned by French troops in April 1866 or when the Apache War ended in 1880.

subheading:  Eduarda Rife

In 1871, Eduarda met and married Thomas Rife in El Paso County, Texas. Her mother may have died in El Paso, Texas in 1914.[^2]

Thomas Rife’s widow qualified for a Widow’s Pension. On January 30, 1895 Francisca applied for Thomas Rife’s accrued pension as his widow.[^3] At a City Council meeting on January 7, 1895, less than two weeks after her husband’s death, Francisca Rife appealed to the City Council to give her husband’s job of Alamo keeper to her oldest son, William.[^4] Although Will Rife undoubtedly knew as much as anyone else about the old monument, it was, considering Will’s history with the courts, a futile appeal.

On January 31, 1895, with the help of Rife’s friends and his old employer, George Giddings, Francisca Rife applied for a Mexican War Widow’s pension 5(148). She stated that she was 40 years old, suffered from asthma and general debility and was unable to earn her living from her own labor and owned no property as evidenced by her absence on Tax Rolls. On April 1, 1895 she, was awarded a Federal pension (Widow’s Certificate #9578) as a Mexican War widow based upon her husband’s service in Walter P. Lane’s Company, Texas Mounted		 the tax rolls. (572) On April 1, 1895 she, was awarded a Federal pension (Widow’s Certificate /#9578) as a Mexican War widow based upon her husband’s service in Walter P. Lane’s Company, Texas Volunteers 6(79, pp. 442) (577).

Thomas Rife’s older sons became delinquents. For a year and a half after their father’s death, William and Thomas stayed out of the newspaper crime reports. Beginning on May 1, 1896 William was involved in a series of petty crimes. He was arrested for stealing money left on the counter at a saloon on Laredo Street 7(216). In the following year he appeared three times in the newspapers. On February 20, 1897 he was arrested for smoking opium at Quong Lee’s opium den 8(215). Then in June 1897, he and Tom, were badly cut in a bar fight that sent Tom to the hospital for two days 9(60) (161). In December Will Rife was arrested for causing a disturbance in a barroom 10(210) and finally on April 7, 1898 he was arrested, with Dan Peñalosa, for defrauding Ida (Waco) Douglas 11(209). This resulted in his banishment from the City of San Antonio. 12(1436)

In May 1898 Rife’s second son, Tom Jr., was charged with petty larceny and released on bond. 13(64) On March of the following year a grand jury indicted Lawrence Rife, Leandro Esqueriño and Jesús Hernandez for burglary with intent to commit theft. 14(208) Lawrence pled guilty and was sentenced by the 37th District Court to two years in the penitentiary on April 5, 1899. 15(170) His name did not appear in the newspapers after his release from prison and he spent the remainder of his life working at the Ursuline Academy in San Antonio. 16(268)

In April 1900, Mrs. Rife was living on San Saba Street and did not pay for furniture she purchased on installment. The owner’s agent, W. T. Neely, attempted to remove it from her house. Not knowing the Rife family, he was unprepared for the resistance they offered. In the resulting disturbance, Mr. Neely was arrested and later convicted of disturbing the peace and fined $10 17(126).

In the Federal Census of June 4, 1900 Francisca was living at 816 South San Saba Street near S. Laredo Street with seven children ranging in ages from 8 to 25 18(107). William was 27-years-old at that time and was not enumerated at this address. Mary Jane (age 25) and Anna (age 22) were already married and Ruth (age 9) was probably with her Godmother and future adopted mother, Josephine M. Flores. The City Directory for 1899-1900 listed the widow and three sons, Will, Thomas Jr. and Morris, living at 116 El Paso Street 19(881, p. 466).

Francisca Rife died in 1900. On August 10, 1900 Francisca Rife signed an Adoption Deed for the purpose of placing 9-year-old Ruth Rife under the protection of her Godmother, Josephine M. Flores. 20(293) In 1900 Miss Flores was a single woman, aged 36, who earned her living as a dressmaker and lived with her brother, a 27-year-old mail carrier. 21(295) Francisca, who was ill, was trying to provide for her children before she died. On August 4, 1900 Francisca received her last Mexican War Widow’s pension of $8. The next check would have been paid on November 4, 1900. She didn’t live long enough to get that quarterly check. Francisca died on August 13, 1900 of Tuberculosis 22(1468) on San Saba Street and was buried the next day. 23(1418) (148) (840 p. 450)

Neither Thomas nor Francisca Eduarda had any known relatives in San Antonio. It is not known who cared for Fred/Federico, age 15; Peter, age 14; Jack/Jacinto, age 11 and Lucy, age 8 until they were old enough to provide for themselves. They probably lived at the house on 116 El Paso Street as long as their older brothers lived there, although the publisher of the San Antonio city directories did not list children until they were 18 years old 24(865, title page). By 1902 the youngest child, Lucy, would have been 10 years old and Jack/Jacinto only 13. Both of these children may have continued to live with their older brothers for many years but there is no evidence to support this.

None of the Rife’s grandchildren were named after their grandparents (Thomas Collins Rife and Francisca Eduarda Saenz Cobos). Jack Rife named his second daughter Josephine but he probably chose that name because his older brother Morris wife was named Josephine. With the exception of Miss Josephine Flores’ adoption of Ruth, there is no evidence that any of the many godparents of Rife’s children took any of the children into their homes after their parent’s deaths.

Little is known of some Thomas Rife’s children after Francisca’s death in 1900.

Most of their children left San Antonio to marry or for employment opportunities. As far as is known only one of the eleven children left the State of Texas to live. The older boys, Will and Tom, may have gone to Mexico but evidence to support this has not been found.

###1. William/Guillermo Wallace Rife#

William was born April 6, 1873 and baptized as Guillermo on May 22, 1973. 25(266) He appeared in the San Antonio newspapers for petty criminal activity many times from the time he was fifteen years old. 26 (211) Ten days after his father’s death Francisca appeared before the city council asking for William to be appointed custodian of the Alamo. He may have been knowledgeable on the subject but his history of petty crimes would have worked against him. 27(125) (1434) He registered to vote on January 10, 1895, probably for the first time and received a certificate of citizenship. 28(383)(186) He was last mentioned in the press on April 7, 1898 when he was arrested for fraud and ordered by the recorder to leave town by the following Monday. 29(1436)

Three months later, William enrolled in Company F, 1st Texas Volunteer Infantry Regiment for the Spanish-American War. He was mustered in at Miami on June 28, 1998. His unit spent three months in Cuba. He spent March 15-22, 1899 in a hospital before being discharged in Galveston, Texas in April 1899. He was a corporal on the date of his discharge. 30(960) The railroad gave the discharged soldiers “a half rate to all points in the State.” 31(1431) He did not appear on the June 1900 Census in his mother’s household. 32(107)

The San Antonio City Directory for 1901-1902 lists him sharing a house at 116 El Paso Street with his brother Tom. 33(287) Nothing else is known of him.

### 2. Thomas/Tomas C. Rife, Jr.

Thomas was born July 16, 1874 and baptized as Tomas on September 13, 1874. 34(267) The June 4, 1900 census which shows him living with his mother and six siblings at 816 South San Saba Street when he was almost 26 years old. There are no known records of Thomas after the San Antonio City Directory for 1901-1902 lists him sharing a house at 116 El Paso Street with his brother William. In a letter to her sister Mary, Anna wrote shortly after her father’s death that Thomas “hasn’t got his right mind. He can not work.” 35(1434)

### 3. Mary Jane Rife

Mary Jane was born December 26, 1875. 36(1424) When she was age 18, Mary Jane married Orrin A.V. Burr Jr. at Trinity M.E. Church in Bexar County on December 4, 1893. The family moved to El Paso, Texas. She had four children: Orrin, Wade Hampton, Ida Belle and Olive. She died in El Paso on February 16, 1935 at age 59 of a ruptured aorta. She is buried at Concordia Cemetery in El Paso. 37(1424)

On July 21 through August 18, 1906 an advertisement appeared in the Dallas and Austin newspapers seeking the whereabouts of Mary Jane and her sister, Anna. The executor in Bolivar, Mississippi implied that they had inherited some property there, 38(735) from Thomas’ brother, William W. Rife who died in 1905. Although deaf and partially paralyzed, “he had accumulated a considerable estate.” 39(1425) Mary Jane responded to Mr. Burrus on February 10, 1909 and received a letter in return inviting her and Anna to visit in Benoit, Mississippi. 40(1422) William Rife’s will left them one-third of one-quarter of the proceeds of his estate equaling eight and one-third percent. It’s not known if they visited or if they received an inheritance. They were living in El Paso and Del Rio respectively.

### 4. Francisca Eduarda Rife    

Francisca was born March 3, 1877 41(382), baptized on May 29, 1879 by father Louis Genolin and died at two years old on June 3, 1879 of small pox. 42(1444)

### 5. Anna Rife

Anna was born June 3, 1878 and baptized on December 10, 1878. Her godparents were Andres Garza and Serafina Marquez. 43(273) She worked as a chambermaid at the Menger Hotel in 1897 and 1898 before and as a servant in the household of John W. Newton in Rock Springs, Texas in June 1900. 44(1472). The following year she married the eldest son, George E. Newton and moved to Del Rio. In 1910 she was living in Del Rio, Val Verde County with two children, Winnie and Bessie. She died there on March 2, 1968 and is buried in Sacred Heart Cemetery.45 (1439)

### 6. Lawrence/Lorenzo Wade Rife

Lawrence Wade was born November 19, 1879 and baptized on January 6, 1882. 46 (268) He was in the penitentiary at Huntsville when Francisca died. He was charged with burglary and sentenced to two years in prison on April 5, 1899. 47(170) He was released on February 11, 1901 after serving one year and 10 months 48(296). He may have been visiting his brother Morris when he was arrested on January 5, 1906 and fined $5 for riding on a train in Beaumont. “In one car alone the officer found thirty-one tramps and hoboes. But most of them succeeded in getting away.” 49(1437) On September 12, 1918 he was employed as a laborer at the Ursuline Academy on Augusta Street, San Antonio. He lived on the grounds of the Academy in 1920 and 1930. In 1938 he was living at 1104 Navarro Street. He worked as a yardman at the Academy his entire adult life.

### 7. Morris/Mauricio Wade Rife

Morris was born February 28, 1881, and baptized as Mauricio on January 29, 1883. 52(283) In 1900 Morris, at 14 years old, was a driver for T. Bruni, a grocery/hardware store owned by a San Antonio merchant, rancher and city politician 53(1433) two days a week. In 1900, nineteen -year old Morris lived with his mother at 816 S. San Saba Street, a mere block away from where Josephine Tafolla was living with the Maldonado family. 54(107) Morris was working in Port Arthur as early as May 31, 1902 when mail was held for him in the Beaumont Post Office. 55(1432) He married Josephine Tafolla in Port Arthur on July 20, 1903 when he was 22 years old. 56(1443)
Morris was in communication in 1909 with his uncle William’s lawyer, Mr. Burrus in Benoit, Mississippi, concerning a possible inheritance. 57(1422) It’s not known what the outcome of this possibility was.

Morris and his family lived in rented houses in Port Arthur and he died on the job while working as a stillman at an oil cake plant at the Gulf Refinery. 58(1429) In 1918 he was of medium height, slender build and had brown eyes and black hair. His family lived nearby at several addresses on W. 18th Street. 59(220)(1429) He had six children of whom five survived to be adults. The children were Mary, Angeline, Morris Gilbert, Eva Francis and Ruth Evelyn. Morris died on July 13, 1921 at age 40, of a pulmonary hemorrhage; perhaps an occupational hazard. 60(1442) Morris was a member of the “Woodmen of the World” whose members served as pallbearers at his funeral. 61(219) He is buried in Magnolia Cemetery in Beaumont. His children grew up and lived in either Port Arthur or Galveston, Texas.

### 8. Fred/Federico Rife

Fred was born in 1885. Nothing is known of Fred Rife except that he died at age 28 years of pulmonary tuberculosis on March 31, 1913 in San Antonio. His last occupation was said to be that of a janitor. He was buried in the City Cemetery #7, San Antonio’s pauper’s cemetery. 62(379) In 1944, the city removed the remains to San Jose Burial Park.

He was described as being 5’8” tall, weighed 130 pounds had gray eyes and black hair with a light brown complexion 64(1019). He died on August 20, 1972 in Lutheran General Hospital of natural causes and is buried in San Fernando #1 Cemetery in San Antonio. When he died he was 86 years old and had never married. 65(1018) According to the Catholic Archives of San Antonio, he was living near Pipe Creek in Bexar County when he died.

### 10. Jack/Jacinto Rife

Jack was born April 21, 1889 and baptized as Jacinto almost ten years later on January 21, 1897 by Father Juan Munos. His Godparents were brother and sister, Antonio and Josefina Flores. 66(1449) He died on March 21, 1978. Sometime before 1910 Jack moved to the community of Von Ormy in Bexar County where Medio Creek joins the Medina River at Quintana Road. In June of 1917 he was working at the Gulf Refinery and living near his brother Morris in Port Arthur. 67(1430) He remained in Von Ormy for the remainder of his life; at some point he was a taxidermist. In the 1910 census he was listed as a railroad worker. 68(91) He married Beronica Benetiz 69(128) and had six children: Carolina, Josephine Melissa, Jack Stephen Jr., Roy Rubin, Alice Grace, and Eloisa A. On May 28, 1915 Jack and his wife, Beronica, inherited her parent’s (Modesto Benitez) land. The inheritance was divided between Beronica and her sister, Juanita. Each heir got ½ acre on the Medina River 70(294). At age 53, Jack was described as 5’5” tall, weighing 170 lbs. with hazel eyes, brown hair and ruddy complexion 71(619). He died in Von Ormy on March 21, 1978 at 89 years old and is buried at San Jose Burial Park, San Antonio. 72(1441)

### 11. Ruth Rife

Ruth was born May 18, 1891 and baptized on January 17, 1897. Her godparents were brother and sister, Antonio And Josephina Flores.73(380) She was nine years old on August 10, 1900, when her godmother, Josephine M. Flores, adopted her. 74(293) On May 5, 1908 Ruth Rife’s adopted mother, Josephine M. Flores, revoked the adoption deed because Ruth “on or about the 17th day of December, 1906” abandoned Miss Flores and “has failed and refused to return”. Ruth was 15 years old at the time she left Miss Flores 75(292). She gave birth to Gwendolyn when she and Walter Beavers were living in Oakland, California. On November 25, 1911, she married Walter Beavers in San Antonio. 76(1471) She and Walter separated while he was in France during World War 1 and Walter brought home a war bride, Adele Dancley.

After several years in New Jersey, Ruth married H.L. Campbell and returned to San Antonio. She lived and worked as a masseuse in her own home in San Antonio for thirty years. She died on July 4, 1975 and is buried in Roselawn Park in San Antonio. 77(1473)

### 12. Lucy Rife

Lucy was born in 1892. 78(107) She was eight years old when her mother died in 1900. 79(1418) Nothing is known of her after that date. On September 22, 1936 a seamstress named Lucy Rife died in Houston. This may or may not be “our” Lucy. In 1982 Morris Rife Jr. of Groves, Texas, told the authors that his aunt Lucy married and moved to California but he may have been confusing her with her sister Ruth. It is possible that Lucy Rife did not exist and was named as a result of an error by the census taker.
