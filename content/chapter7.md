# West Texas after the Civil War, 1866-1872

## Ficklin Mail Service, 1866-1872

*“After the war closed, he was again on the west Texas mail service and did good service, remaining in it until 1873, when western Texas had become so well organized and settled that there was no need for further armed service in that direction”, “Custodian of the Alamo,” San Antonio Light, February 23, 1887.*

### Civil government struggled to function after the Civil War.

After the surrender of the last Confederate army on May 26, 1865,[^1] up to 2,000 Confederate officers and soldiers, including Texas Governor Pendleton Murrah, fled to Mexico.[^2] Law and order in Texas started to break down without these leaders.[^3]

During summer and fall of 1865, the postal service became very unreliable.[^4] Some private express operations were carrying mail but there was no scheduled mail service between San Antonio and the upper Rio Grande Valley. Indian attacks along the frontier continued unabated;[^5] there were no troops in place to protect travelers on the West Texas roads.[^6]

### Mail service resumed in 1866.

Bethel Coopwood was the first contractor to reopen mail service between San Antonio and El Paso after the Civil War.[^7] Bethel Coopwood began his enterprise as a freight hauler between San Antonio and El Paso and Chihuahua. The San Antonio Ledger, in July, 1866, called the mail company the “Southern Overland Stage and Express Company.”[^8] The first mail train left San Antonio on April 24, accompanied by forty mounted men. After crossing the Pecos River near the deserted Fort Lancaster, the party was attacked by Chief Espejo and José Cigarito and a large war party of Native American warriors. Many of the stage escorts were armed with repeating rifles. The Indians were not familiar with these weapons and were easily driven off. This delivery was the first mail to arrive in El Paso from San Antonio in nearly four years.[^9]

In November 1866, Coopwood transferred the stage coach property to Frederick A. Sawyer.[^10] James Holliday supervised the transition and became an agent of the new company.[^11] Sawyer’s contract called for three mail trains per week between San Antonio and El Paso.[^12]

In December 1866, Federal troops occupied Fort Clark and Fort Mason.[^13] Fort Clark was occupied by the Confederacy during the war but Fort Mason was not. It was not until July 1867, that Federal troops arrived at Fork Stockton.[^14] Prior to that, Coopwood’s men never managed to get more than two mail trains a week past Mescalero Indian Chief Espejo and his band.[^15] The newspapers in San Antonio complained that, from November 1866 through May 1867, a period of twenty-eight weeks, only twelve mail trains had successfully completed the trip.

The post Civil War Indian raids began in July 1866 when 125 Apache warriors attacked the eastbound stage at Varela Spring and also the westbound stage at Lancaster Hill. According to one observer, Comanche Indians “roamed over an immense region, eating the raw flesh of the buffalo, drinking its warm blood, and plundering Mexicans, Indians and white with judicial impartiality.”[^16] Attacks were expected and, while disruptive, did not stop the mail contractor. By November and December 1866, contractors were repairing stage stands and purchasing livestock prior to beginning mail runs between San Antonio and El Paso.[^17] Traffic along the San Antonio-El Paso Upper and Lower roads increased despite continuing Native American depredations.[^18] By 1867, the Lower Road was so heavily used by freighters that it was said to be "seldom that a person could cross the road without seeing" wagons.[^19]

### The US Army returned to Fort Davis in 1867.

In June 1867, troops of the Ninth Cavalry and Forty-first Infantry Regiments occupied Fort Davis. They began to build a new post adjacent to the ruins of the old one. Fort Stockton was re-occupied on July 12, 1867, by four companies of the Ninth Cavalry composed of black troops recruited from the area around New Orleans.[^20]

Sawyer’s new mail contract started on July 1, 1867 but the first mail, which was accompanied by the line’s new manager, Benjamin Franklin Ficklin, left San Antonio on the Lower Road three months later. The mail stations on the new route (the Upper Road) were not yet ready. The mail train found that Indians had filled Howard's Well and Eagle Springs with earth but the train reached El Paso safely.[^21] The second west-bound mail train was lost a few miles north of Howard’s Well when Kickapoo Indians captured the pack mules and killed two troopers from the Ninth Cavalry.[^22]

Fort Quitman, on the Rio Grande, was reoccupied on January 1, 1868 by one company of the Ninth Cavalry[^23] and “fought a dozen skirmishes with Mescalero Indians in only a few weeks.”[^24] Starting in March, tri-weekly mail service began to go through Fredericksburg and Fort Mason along the Upper San Antonio-El Paso Road. After crossing the Pecos River at Horsehead Crossing, the mail train continued to Fort Stockton and then followed the Lower Road to Forts Davis and Quitman and on to El Paso.[^25] The new route passed through more settled areas than did the Lower Road and was therefore easier to protect and maintain. However, there were still long stretches of road without settlements. West of Fort Concho there were no settlements until Fort Stockton, a distance of 150 miles through Indian country.[^26] The stage traveled, “all day upon the silent desert, stopping only to change mules at lonely little stations.”[^27]

On June 3, 1868, T. G. Williams, the agent in San Antonio, announced express mail service through to El Paso in 6½ days. The stage left San Antonio on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8 o’clock  in the morning.  There were connections at Fort Stockton to Presidio del Norte. Another coach left San Antonio on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at seven o’clock in the morning for Eagle Pass and Fort Clark via Castroville, New Fountain, D’Hanis and Uvalde.[^28]

### The stage company expanded its operations in West Texas in 1869.

In January 1869 Ben Ficklin purchased 640 acres on the south bank of the Middle Concho River and expanded his existing headquarters there. He built wagon shops and sheds for harness makers, wheelwrights and blacksmiths as well as a warehouse and corrals for stock. In January 1870, Ficklin’s weekly stage schedule was increased to semiweekly service and coaches replaced the buckboard wagons that had been used between Fort Concho and Fort Stockton.[^29]

In the early 1870’s, US Major Zenas R. Bliss returned to duty in west Texas. As was his custom throughout his military career, he kept a diary of his trip. He said of the coach drivers that, “Each driver drove about a hundred to a hundred and twenty-five miles, day and night, stopping at stations only long enough to swallow a hasty meal. While the driver and escort were eating, the station keeper and his helper hitched up a fresh team of mules, and held them till all were aboard, and then turned them loose, and they would go upon the run for a mile or more, and then they would settle down to a trot and go along peaceably. The mules were trained not to stand still in the road.” “If a passenger needed to get out of the coach between stations it was not necessary to stop the coach, the passenger would jump out and the coach would go on again on a run and the driver would run the mules in a circle, and after a while bring them back” to where the passenger was standing. The passenger would jump in and off they went again.[^30]

### Thomas Rife worked for the stage line until 1872.

There is evidence that Thomas Rife continued to work for the mail line during this period. George Baylor, who was for many years a Ranger captain in the upper Rio Grande Valley, implied that at some time before 1873, Thomas Rife was in charge of a mail station on the Rio Grande between Fort Quitman and Ysleta[^31] near where Camp Rice and later Fort Hancock were located.[^32]

Stagecoaches in west Texas did a brisk business in both express packages and passengers until the railroads were built and placed in service. The stagecoach line prospered as the country filled up with settlers. In January 1882, the Texas and Pacific Railroad reached El Paso from the east.[^33] After the railroad was built and given the contract to carry the mail, stage coach conductors and guards were put out of business.[^34]


## Pecos County, 1870-1873

### Captain Rife remained in West Texas until 1872.

By 1870 Tom Rife was 47 years old and had worked for 18 years in the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas. He was known as Captain Rife because of his work as a conductor of stagecoaches.[^35] In that capacity, he was responsible for the stagecoach and its passengers, the mail it carried and the men who drove and protected it. Shortly after the War he returned to San Antonio but by 1870 was again west of the Pecos River in what later became Pecos County.

By July 1866, mail coaches resumed operations between San Antonio and El Paso.[^36] Despite frequent attacks by Indians, the mail stations were repaired and stocked with livestock[^37] and by the following spring three mail wagons were stopping at Fort Stockton every week.[^38]

The road between San Antonio and El Paso, already a well-marked highway, was improved.[^39] In 1868 a bridge was constructed over the Pecos River[^40] in a location that previously was crossed on a skiff when the water was high.[^41] Two years later, the bridge was replaced by a new pontoon bridge that quickly became the main crossing.[^42] Also, once a week, the mail coach travelled from Fort Stockton and Fort Davis to Presidio del Norte on the Rio Grande.[^43]

### Thomas Rife was qualified to hold public office.

Rife surrendered to Federal authorities in San Antonio in 1865, as was required of those who served in the Civil War as Confederates.[^44] He took a loyalty oath before he was paroled[^45] The general amnesty required only a simple oath of loyalty to the US Constitution and its laws.[^46] Two years later a stricter oath, called the “ironclad oath” was introduced.[^47] Anyone who could or would not take this second oath was prevented from serving as a juror or acting as a state or local official. The oath stated that he had not given “aid, countenance, counsel or encouragement” to the Confederacy.

In the election of 1869 all candidates who had won their election but who could not take the ironclad oath were disqualified from taking office.[^48] The requirement to swear the ironclad oath would have prevented Rife from standing for election in a county election if as a mail carrier he had previously taken an oath to the US Constitution.[^49] In practice, prior to the Civil War, only postmasters and mail contractors were required to take an oath to the US Constitution.[^50] As a result, Rife was qualified to hold public office after the Civil War.[^51]

Local boards were appointed to administer the loyalty oath and to register voters.[^52] In 1869, the Texas voter registration boards were mostly partisans of the radical Republican candidate for governor, E. J. Davis.[^53] However, the restrictions placed on former Confederates may have been relaxed in the Trans-Pecos region because the Republican Party considered Texas west of the Colorado River to have been loyal to the Union.[^54]

Stagecoach drivers and guards, and especially those of the mail service, were seen by the federal government as trustworthy.[^55] Rife was well known in West Texas and law-abiding citizens of the region welcomed him[^56] when he resumed his work as a mail carrier after the war.[^57] Rife was acquainted with many of the influential men in West Texas and these contacts and old friends would have been important to Rife and surely influenced his decision to return there.

A generation later in 1891, affadavits by Rife and George Giddings described the exact location of San Martin Springs, of vital importance in determining the boundary line between El Paso, Jeff Davis and Reeves Counties.[^58] In Rife’s mail service days it was known as Barrilla Spring.    

### West Texas forts were re-occupied by the US Army beginning in 1867.

Immediately after the war, the U.S. military was preoccupied with establishing an occupying force in the settled regions of Texas and along the Rio Grande and did not began to return to the Trans-Pecos until after the French had left Mexico in June 1867. After this time, the Army responded to Indian depredations by gradually increasing its presence in the Trans-Pecos region.[^60]

The US Government renounced the Quaker Peace policy that previously governed its relationship with indigenous peoples and became more aggressive in its treatment of Indians. Many Indians were forcibly confined to reservations.[^61] The Texas Legislature abolished the widely distrusted State Police[^62] and reinstated the ranger service[^63] to reduce tensions between ex-Confederates and state authorities.[^64]

Buffalo soldiers were African American soldiers who mainly served on the Western frontier following the American Civil War. In 1866, six all-black cavalry and infantry regiments were created after Congress passed the Army Organization Act. Their main tasks were to help control the Native Americans of the Plains, capture cattle rustlers and thieves and protect settlers, stagecoaches, wagon trains and railroad crews along the Western front. Beginning in January 1869, Forts Stockton, Davis, Quitman, Clark, McKavett, Concho and Duncan were garrisoned by black infantry and cavalry companies, known as the Buffalo soldiers.

Fort Bliss had been occupied by black troops since June 1865.[^65] The transition from garrisons of Anglo-European soldiers to black troops apparently went smoothly in West Texas. State and military officials in east Texas, where the white population would not accept black troops, took notice of this. In February 1869, some Republican lawmakers wanted to divide the state of Texas into two or three states[^66] in order to separate unrepentant Confederates in the east from those in West Texas whom they considered to be loyal to the Union. The area to the west of the Colorado River was considered to be safe for freedmen and the black soldiers and could be granted self-government without fear of adverse consequences.[^67]

### The Legislature created Pecos County in 1870.

The Republican-led Texas Legislature appointed three commissioners to hold an election to form Presidio County in the Big Bend area of the Rio Grande.[^68] In 1871, Pecos County was created. A board to organize the new county was to be appointed on the first Monday in May of that year but the members of the board were not appointed until May 12. This may have been why the attempt to organize of the county failed.[^69]

Peter Gallagher, a merchant in both Fort Stockton[^70] and San Antonio, was instrumental in forming at least two county governments in the Trans-Pecos region. He served on the Board of Commissioners for Presidio County in 1870.[^71] Choosing the county seat was of paramount importance to landowners and merchants. They often owned real estate and had mercantile businesses to protect.

### Thomas Rife was elected Justice of the Peace in 1872.

On January 13, 1872, Tom Rife was elected a Justice of a Peace in Pecos County at Fort Stockton.[^72] Rife won the election for Precinct No. 3 with 14 votes to 11 and 1 in a three-way race and was commissioned on February 29.[^73] The third precinct was in far eastern Pecos County on the Pecos River. Perhaps Rife was working there as a mail station manager.[^74] 1872 was also a national election year. During the November election (which ran for four days) Horace Greeley, the Democratic and Liberal Republican candidate, received 25 votes for President and U.S. Grant, the Radical Republican candidate, received 18 votes. There were only 45 registered voters in the new county, described as "26 whites, 10 Mexicans and 9 colored men."[^74]"

There is no evidence that the elected county officials ever met and this election did not result in the seating of a county court of commissioners. Ballot stuffing and vote buying was the order of the day in most county elections of this kind and the election in Presidio County proved to be no exception.[^75] In November 1872, the returns of El Paso and Presidio counties were thrown out “on account of mob violence, intimidation and undue influence”[^76] The Secretary of State may also have decided that the Pecos County vote was not valid because the county did not have a sufficient number of registered voters to entitle them to organize a county government.[^77]

Rife might not have served as a Justice of the Peace after his election as the records are unclear. Three years later, in March 1875, a special election was held in Pecos County to fill vacancies that included District Clerk, Sheriff, Treasurer, County Surveyor, Hide Inspector, and all five Justices of the Peace.[^78] Another general election was held the next year and elected a new set of officials. In January 1876, precinct boundaries were again delineated.[^79] The earliest records in the Pecos County Courthouse in Fort Stockton date from 1875.

### Thomas Rife and his wife left Pecos County in 1873.

It is unclear what Rife was doing in Pecos County in January 1872 and why he stood for election as a Justice of the Peace. At that time, he and his wife lived in or near Fort Stockton.[^80] He was eligible to serve as a county official and was accepted as eligible by the voter registrars who also supervised the elections.[^81] With only 45 registered voters in the proposed county, the list of possible candidates would have been short. In 1870, US military authorities stipulated that each county had to have five Justices of the Peace so as to constitute the police court. Each Justice of the Peace had to post a bond of $500 to the county police court.[^82] The requirement to post a bond of such a large amount further narrowed the field of perspective candidates.

Soon after the election, Rife left Pecos County. He may have known that the era of cross-country stagecoaches was over; the heroic period of Texas history, and his role in it, was fast drawing to a close. The Southern Pacific Railroad from San Diego, California reached El Paso in May 1881. The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fé Railroad reached El Paso from the east in June 1881. The Texas & Pacific Railroad followed in January 1883. The railroads led to a large shift in the population; many workers of all races suffered from downward mobility after the closing of the frontier (i.e. after the coming of the railroads).[^83]

Freighters who hauled merchandise between San Antonio and the Rio Grande Valley disappeared when the Southern Pacific Railroad reached Eagle Pass in 1878 and the Great Northern Railroad reached Laredo in 1883.[^84] In 1877, the first train of the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio route entered San Antonio and its bell, reaching the ears of the men who drove stages and who freighted goods, tolled the demise of long-distance mail coaches and freight trains. A second railroad, the International and Great Northern railroad reached San Antonio from Houston in 1880. In 1883 and 1885 routes were opened to Corpus Christi and Kerrville, respectively[^85] In 1886, Pap Howard reportedly drove the last stage out of San Antonio to San Angelo. According to a newspaper reporter, “it was with tears in their eyes that many of the city’s intrepid pioneers watched him disappear into the distance.”[^86] They realized that the days of the cross-country stagecoaches and freight trains pulled by mules had come to an end.
