# The Mexican War, 1846-1848

*“In 1842, when Texas was last invaded, Tom Rife volunteered for her defense and he served two enlistments in the Mexican war, and was in the fray from beginning to the end. One of those enlistments was served under a man dear to Texas, Jack Hayes, the other under Walter P Lane. No one has yet risen to question his courage or service.” “Custodian of the Alamo,” San Antonio Light, (San Antonio, Texas), February 23, 1887*

### The Minutemen of Bexar became Hay’s Rangers.

In the turmoil during and after the war for Texas independence, many progressive and industrious Mexican inhabitants of San Antonio left for Mexico;[^1] much of the Mexican population of Nacogdoches and displaced Native Americans who had gathered in east Texas[^2] were forced to leave the Republic by the victorious Anglo-Americans.[^3] The Anglo population itself consisted of a majority of honest farmers but also a large minority of “loafers” who drifted from one opportunity to another.[^4]

After Texas became a republic, the Texas Army was disbanded[^5] and defense of the frontier was turned over to the militia and county ranging companies.[^6] In the absence of a standing army, the ranging companies provided a body of paramilitary troopers who could lead militia and volunteer forces in the continuing faceoff with Mexico.[^7] These civilian soldiers were often called minutemen.[^8] The primary purpose of the minutemen was to punish Indian and Mexican raiders that were attacking settlers. As early as 1836, the frontier defenses came to rely on independent[^9] and short-term[^10] but full-time ranging companies paid by the Legislature and commissioned by the Governor.[^11]

John Coffee (Jack) Hays, the commander of the minutemen of Bexar County,[^12] became the most famous ranger captain.[^13] Hays entered the ranger service as a 20-year old in late 1836 soon after arriving in Texas from Mississippi.[^14] He served as the commander of a company of rangers around San Antonio almost continually from 1841 until the Mexican War.[^15] He and his rangers developed techniques that eventually neutralized and then reversed the advantage that Comanche Indians had previously enjoyed in a fight with the Spanish military and Anglo settlers.[^16]

Hays received his first commission as a ranger captain shortly after the battle of Plum Creek in August of 1840[^17] and continued in military service until about 1848. The young men who served in Jack Hays’ ranging companies in 1841-1842 formed the nucleus of his Mexican War regiments in 1846.[^18] Other young adventure-seeking young men, such as Walter P. Lane, who never formally served in Hays’ ranger companies, joined Hays’ command, on occasion, as amateurs to learn how to pursue and defeat Comanche raiders.[^19]

### Jack Hays built his rangers into a creditable military organization.

Most men who applied to join Hays’ rangers could not meet the requirements for enlistment set by Hays. His caution in selecting recruits enabled him to create what is considered to be the best set of Indian fighters that Texas ever produced. Hays’ rangers patrolled an area of 40 to 50 miles and in later years lived in a camp on the Medina River. They patrolled continually in groups of three men led by a sergeant. Few of Hays’ rangers were over 22 years old.[^20]

Hays initially established a camp at Leon Creek seven miles west of San Antonio.[^21] By 1844, he had moved the camp to the Medina River several miles above the site of Castroville.[^22] Between June 1 and September 30, 1843, Hays and 25 to 37 men ranged the region south of San Antonio.[^23] After 1844 the rangers provided security for the outlying settlements at Castroville, Quihi Lake, Vanderburg and D’Hanis.[^24] These settlements were on the Indian frontier and were protected by a squad of rangers stationed at a camp on Seco Creek, two miles from D’Hanis.[^25] In 1844, there were 30 rangers stationed in Béxar County, 15 in Travis County and 15 each in Refugio and Goliad.[^26] The rangers were charged with patrolling their assigned areas searching for and pursuing raiders who, in the 1840s, were usually Comanche Indians or their allies.[^27]

### The rangers eventually found a way to defeat Horse Indians.

On March 19, 1840, Texas soldiers killed, at the Council House Fight, a number of Comanche chiefs who had come to San Antonio to negotiate the return of captives.[^28] This was the third attempt to sign a treaty with the Comanche.[^29] The hope of peaceful relations between the Texans and the Comanche Indians that had been promoted by Sam Houston[^30] was extinguished and not revived until 1853.[^31]

Most encounters between Anglos, Mexicans and the Comanche Indians were the result of horse-stealing raids.[^32] By 1840, stealing livestock from Mexico and Texas during the winter months was a tradition of the Southern Comanche.[^33] After each raid, the settlers pursued the Indians and attempted to recover kidnapped women, children and horses. However, Indian raiders mounted on horses usually escaped the pursuing settlers.[^34]

Even when the settlers managed to catch an Indian raiding party the outcome was uncertain. Settlers armed with single-shot, muzzle loading long rifles had to dismount to fire and reload. The Indians carried short bows that were accurate at short and medium range. For close fighting, the Comanche carried lances that were sometimes tied to the wrist by a cord. The shields that they carried on their left arm were made of several layers of buffalo hide[^35] and could deflect musket balls.[^36] Until the Anglos obtained repeating firearms, the two sides were about evenly matched in fire power in close quarter fights.[^37]

Jack Hays and his ranging company were the first to employ repeating pistols in a fight with Comanche raiders.[^38] During a fight on Walker Creek on June 1844, Jack Hays and 15 men used, for the first time, newly acquired Colt Paterson five-shot revolvers. These guns were bought for the Texas Navy and acquired by the rangers when President Sam Houston disbanded the Texas Navy in 1843.[^39] The ability to reload while galloping on horseback revolutionized the ranger’s fighting style and finally gave them the upper hand over mounted Comanche Indians.[^40] After the introduction of the six-shooters, the settlers gained an even greater advantage and Indian fights became simply chases.[^41]

### The war between Texas and Mexico began again in 1842.

The United Mexican States did not recognize the independence of the Republic of Texas despite the agreement signed by President López de Santa Anna in 1836.[^42] In 1842, Santa Anna was once again President of Mexico and the republics of Texas and Mexico were once again at war.[^43] Texas President Mirabeau Lamar sent 270 armed men on a trading mission called the Santa Fé Expedition in June 1841. The expedition was meant to be a joint political, military and commercial enterprise[^44] but the Mexican government interpreted it as an armed invasion.[^45] The participants in the expedition were captured and imprisoned.[^46]

To revenge the invasion of New Mexico by the Santa Fé Expedition, President Santa Anna sent troops to invade Texas.[^47] Seven hundred Mexican soldiers under Gen. Rafael Vásquez briefly occupied San Antonio in early March, 1842.[^48] In response to the Vásquez invasion, the President of Texas called out the militia.

In July 1842, Mexican soldiers under Colonel Antonio Canales approached Corpus Christi. In September 1842, Mexican troops under General Adrian Woll, once again occupied San Antonio.[^49] General Woll’s army of 1,600 men cut a new road from Presidio de Río Grande to San Antonio that crossed the Leona River at Woll’s Crossing, four miles south of Mt. Inge.[^50] In this way, the army escaped detection by scouts sent out by Jack Hays and arrived unobserved at San Antonio in the morning of September 11, 1842.[^51]

Hays, who had been out on a scout when the city was taken, quickly assembled a body of volunteer soldiers to prevent the Mexican army from proceeding north towards Austin, the Republic’s capital.[^52] On September 17, 1842, the two forces met near where the city of New Braunfels is today and, after the Battle of Salado Creek, General Woll and his army retreated back to San Antonio.[^53] The Mexican army left San Antonio on September 20 and returned to Mexico.[^54]

### President Houston authorized an invasion of Mexico in 1842.

In October 1842, following the earlier assault on San Antonio, General Alexander Somervell (commander of the western militia brigade) was authorized by Texas President Sam Houston to invade Mexico.[^55] On November 18, 1842, Somervell’s Texans, led by Jack Hays and his scouts, left San Antonio with 750 men. On December 8, Somervell’s forces captured the town of Laredo on the northern bank of the Rio Grande. On December 19, General Somervell ordered his remaining volunteers to return to his base camp at Gonzales.[^56] Two hundred men, including Hays’ company of rangers, thinking the expedition was over,[^57]returned to San Antonio[^58] but other men refused to abandon the invasion; instead they reorganized their forces and began what became known as the Mier Expedition. They crossed the Rio Grande and attempted to capture the town of Mier. On December 26, 1842, the Mexican Army captured 260 Texans at Mier after a long battle.[^59]

In negotiations that followed,[^60] Mexico was willing to give the State of Texas autonomy if it would remain in the Mexican republic.[^61] They continued to consider Texas a Mexican state until 1847.[^62] Texan and American politicians, however, refused to acknowledge Mexico’s claim to Texas and in December of 1844 a bill annexing Texas to the United States passed the US Senate.[^63] A Texas Constitutional Convention agreed that the Republic would be come part of the United States on July 7, 1845.[^64]

### The United States started the Mexican War after annexation of Texas.

In June 1845, a large part of the US Army was gathered at Fort Jessup in western Louisiana near the Sabine River in anticipation of a war with Mexico.[^65] The US Army commander, General Edmund Gaines, was instructed to move his troops to the disputed Texas border in advance of February 19, 1846, when the state would be formally annexed to the US.[^66] By the time the Texas Constitutional Convention accepted the bill annexing Texas to the United States, US General Zachery Taylor was moving his army to New Orleans to take ships to Texas. On July 31, 1845, General Taylor’s army arrived at Corpus Christi Bay on the Texas coast and camped on the Nueces River for the next nine months[^67] waiting for the Mexicans to initiate war.[^68]

One reason Texas sought annexation to the United States was the expectation that the US Army would assume the expense of defending the frontier.[^69] Jack Hays unsuccessfully approached General Taylor in an attempt to integrate his ranging company into the US Army.[^70] Although his offer was initially refused, after 1845 Texas ranging companies were usually attached to Federal troops and paid by the US government.

The Rio Grande del Norte was the border claimed by the Republic of Texas;[^71] US President Polk had campaigned for election on a promise to occupy the Nueces Strip.[^72] Accordingly on March 8, 1846, General Taylor began to move his army from the Nueces River to the Rio Grande. On March 27, the American troops arrived at the north bank of the Rio Grande and constructed Fort Texas (later renamed Fort Brown) opposite the Mexican town of Matamoros.[^73] It was this advance from the Nueces River to the Rio Grande that finally provoked the start of the Mexican War.

On April 24, 1846, General Mariano Arista, in command at Matamoros, announced that hostilities had begun.[^74] In a letter to Governor Henderson on April 26, 1846, General Taylor stated that “hostilities have actually commenced” and requested that four regiments of Texas volunteers be called into service. Two regiments were to be mounted and two were to be infantry.[^75]

In May 1846 Mexican and American troops clashed at Palo Alto Prairie between the US Army’s supply base at Port Isabel and Fort Brown. After the Battle of Resaca de la Palma the following day, the Mexican army retreated to Matamoros and Taylor followed them as far as Fort Brown.[^76] During this campaign, a company of US Army Dragoons was captured while on a scout and Samuel Walker’s company of Texas mounted irregulars proved valuable as scouts and messengers.[^77] The combination of events convinced General Taylor to accept Texas Rangers into Federal service. Reporters from American newspapers accompanied the troops and their stories about Walker’s company contributed to the growing mythology of the Texas Rangers.[^78]  

### Tom Rife enlisted in the First Texas Mounted Rifles.

On May 4, 1846, even before General Taylor called for volunteers, Jack Hays visited Austin to ask permission to recruit a regiment of volunteers for the war.[^79] Texas Governor James Pinckney Henderson approved and Hays, with Samuel Walker, left for Washington-on-the-Brazos to recruit men who had experience as rangers, their preferred recruits. While in Brenham, Washington County, Hays and Walker called for volunteers at a public meeting sponsored by John B. Wilkins, Sr., a local merchant. The gathering concluded with a barbeque and dance. The next day the two men proceeded east to visit other towns.[^80] Between May 15 and May 19, 1846, as a result of Hays’ visit, sixty-four men in Brenham enrolled in a company headed by Frank S. Early.[^81] Among the men who enrolled was 23-year-old Thomas Rife.[^82]

Thanks in part to the “Narrative of the Texan Santa Fé Expedition” written by George W Kendall of the New Orleans Picayune newspaper,[^83] the response to the call for volunteers was overwhelming.[^84] Volunteers from the States as well as Texas responded in large numbers.[^85] Colonel George Wood was appointed by the governor to lead a regiment of mounted troops from east Texas.[^86] General Albert Sydney Johnston commanded a regiment of infantry and Governor James Henderson with the Legislature’s permission,[^87] commanded the two other Texas regiments.[^88] All of the Texas troops were riflemen.[^89]

In June 1846, the headquarters of Colonel Jack Hays’ Regiment of First Texas Mounted Rifles was located at Point Isabel (near the mouth of the Rio Grande). This was the rendezvous for the four Texas regiments.[^90] Most of these men enlisted for six months.[^91] On June 7, 1846 Thomas Rife mustered into Company F as a 2nd Corporal, indicating that he must have had previous military experience. Company F, commanded by Captain Frank S. Early, was assigned to the 1st Regiment, Texas Mounted Rifles, commanded by Colonel Jack Hays.[^92]

On June 11, 1846, Rife was still with Frank Early’s Company F[^93]at Point Isabel but on July 11 he was detached from Company F and assigned to Captain Samuel L. S. Ballowe’s Company D.[^94] He remained on the roll of Company F as absent on detached service.[^95] Both Companies were stationed around Point Isabel. Samuel Ballowe’s Company D was recruited in Brazonia and Matagorda counties[^96] with only twenty-five men when they arrived at the rendezvous at Point Isabel on June 19. They were finally mustered into service on July 14[^97] but only after inducing men, such as Tom Rife, to transfer in from other companies.

Some of Hay’s former rangers traveled long distances to sign up for service. The Texas captains selected their recruits carefully and rejected those who did not meet their standards.[^98] As a result, the regiment spent the entire month of June getting the required ten companies organized and staffed.[^99] Regimental officers were elected on June 22.[^100] Jack Hays was elected colonel, Samuel Walker was elected lieutenant colonel and Michael H. Chevallie was elected major. The men were issued army wagons and camp equipage but they refused army uniforms.[^101] The Texans dressed as they did in civilian life with woolen shirts dyed with hickory nuts, buckskin leather pants, slouch hats, moccasins and knives and pistols in their belts.[^102] Many sported full beards and handlebar mustaches.[^103]

### The US Army invaded Mexico in 1846.

In July and August 1846, General Taylor marched one brigade of infantry with artillery and cavalry along the south side of the Rio Grande through Reynosa[^104] and on to Camargo City in the State of Tamaulipas. The remaining infantry were carried between Point Isabel and Camargo City in chartered steamboats[^105] operated by Captain Richard King.[^106]

The eight Texas mounted companies were sent out to locate the Mexican army[^107] and to occupy towns and villages along the army’s intended route.[^108] They found the Mexican Army concentrated at Monterrey. A reporter from the New Orleans Picayune accompanied Hay’s command and dispatched colorful stories of their exploits.[^109]

In preparation for the advance on Monterrey, General Taylor organized his army into 1st Division, 2nd Division and Texas Divisions. Two thousand men were left at Camargo and the remainder formed into three columns. They left Camargo, marched through Mier and were brought together at Cerralvo, sixty miles from Monterrey[^110]on September 9.[^111] On September 13, the army arrived at Papagayo farm[^112] where Ballowe’s Company D had been camped since August 31.[^113]  

On September 19, the 4,000 US regular and volunteer troops of Taylor’s army reached the outskirts of Monterrey and camped at Santo Domingo where the Americans established a base camp they called Walnut Springs.[^114] The Texas volunteers were sent out to forage and rain began to fall during the night.[^115]

### Thomas Rife participated in the Battle of Monterrey.

On September 20, 1846, the Battle of Monterrey began. The Texans left their bedding and cooking utensils in camp because they thought that they would return to their camp that night but they were not able to return for four days after the city surrendered. They were forced to eat roasted green corn stolen from nearby fields[^116] and to sleep on the ground in their shirtsleeves.[^117]

Two hundred and fifty men of Hays’ Regiment were chosen and assigned to Brigadier. General Worth’s 2nd Division and were ordered to attack the city from the west. Colonel Hays accompanied these men into battle.[^118] The 2nd Division and the men of Hays’ Regiment left their camp at Walnut Springs and were close to the Saltillo Road by six o’clock in the evening. Ballowe’s Company, to which Rife was attached, was involved in a skirmish at sundown that was stopped by heavy rain. That night the Texans bedded down in the barnyard of the San Jerónimo ranch west of the city.[^119]

Early on the morning of September 21, Texas troops moved toward the Saltillo Road[^120] where they dismounted and, shortly after daylight, skirmished with a company of Mexican lancers.[^121] On this second day of battle, Ballowe’s Company helped capture a pair of batteries located across the Arroyo Topa from the city.[^122] In the early morning hours of the third day of battle, dismounted cavalry, including Rife’s unit,[^123] scaled a steep slope and captured a battery on the hill above the old Bishop’s Palace.[^124] They then captured the Bishop’s Palace itself that had been fortified by the Mexican army.[^125]

On the following day, September 23, American troops entered Monterrey and moved to within one block of Main Plaza from both the west and east in house-to-house fighting.[^126] The American soldiers dared not show themselves in the streets leading to the plaza because of the deadly cannon fire from the Plaza. By punching holes in the walls of the buildings and, using ladders and pick-axes,[^127] they moved from house to house towards Main Plaza.[^128]  

The city surrendered on September 24 and the Mexican troops were allowed to leave for San Luis Potosí, Linares and points south. General Don Pedro Ampudia and his army retreated to San Luis Potosí and that city became the headquarters of the Mexican army in the north.[^129]

Following the capture of Monterrey, all Texas volunteer troops were mustered out of Federal service and returned home to Texas.[^130] General Taylor began to muster out the Texas troops on September 30[^131] and Tom Rife was mustered out on October 2, as a sergeant.[^132] He was paid for his four-months of service, given a clothing allowance[^133] and returned to Washington County where his uncle Nathaniel Chambliss lived. It is not known if he traveled overland or by steamer from Camargo. Rife’s first company commander, Captain Frank Early, traveled by steamer. He died in the Tremont Hotel in Galveston from an illness that he contracted in Mexico while on his way home.[^134]

### Rife reenlisted before the Battle of Buena Vista.

On February 1, 1847, Walter P. Lane (who had served as a lieutenant in Hays’ first regiment) and his friend Governeur Nelson traveled from San Antonio to Fayette County to recruit a company of rangers for the duration of the war. Few men were willing to make such an indefinite commitment.[^135] Rife, on the other hand, did not hesitate. He enrolled in Lane’s Company that same day and was enlisted for three months or the duration of the war.[^136]

On February 13, 1847, Lane’s company gathered at San Antonio, the announced rendezvous. The company included 12 men who had served in Jack Hays’s regiment at the battle at Monterrey, four former Mier prisoners and fifteen volunteers from Mississippi. It was grouped with two other companies to form a battalion commanded by Mike Chevallié,[^137] a stalwart of Jack Hay’s rangers during the 1840s. Rife mustered in as 3rd Sergeant.[^138]

In the meantime the war in Mexico continued. On February 15, 1847, General Winfield Scott, with most of General Taylor’s regular troops, sailed from Brazos de Santiago for Tampico to begin the Mexico City campaign.[^139] On February 23, 1847, General Taylor’s remaining force met and defeated a much larger force of Mexicans south of Saltillo in what became known as the Battle of Buena Vista.[^140]

The 1st Battalion was assigned to General Taylor’s army in northern Mexico. Its ranging district was to be Saltillo to Camargo.[^141] The volunteers provided their own mounts and at the time of Rife’s enlistment, his horse was an 8-year old sorrel gelding measuring 14½ hands(58”), valued at $35.[^142]

Chevallie’s Battalion of 300 men left San Antonio on March 8, 1847, and reached Camargo City on March 23, 1847. The day after Chevallie’s battalion left San Antonio, General Winfield Scott’s army landed near Vera Cruz and launched the campaign that ended with the capture of Mexico City.[^143] Two days after arriving in Camargo, the three companies of Chevallie’s battalion officially organized as a battalion and elected Chevallie its commander with the rank of major. The men remained in the vicinity of Camargo for a few weeks and then started for Monterrey to join General Taylor’s army.[^144]

On April 4, 1847, Chevallie’s command left Camargo and arrived at China, Mexico on April 9 and camped on the outskirts of the town for a week. On April 15, 1847 the men with the battalion’s best and healthiest horses were selected to continue up the south fork of the San Juan River to Montemorelos, a town in the foothills about 55 miles south of China. The rest of the battalion, led by Lt. G.H. Nelson escorted a regiment of Virginia infantry and its supply train to Monterrey along the main road.

The detachment commanded by Major Chevallie proceeded to Montemorelos through a densely populated valley where forage and food were abundant. Local officials appeared to be friendly towards the Americans and reported that Mexican General Urrea had retreated towards San Luis Potosí.[^145] The month of April 1847 was spent guarding foraging trains and scouting the countryside.[^146]

### Rife’s unit was stationed at Monterrey in 1847.

On April 30, 1847, Rife’s unit was stationed at Monterrey.[^147] The battalion of Major Mike Chevallie (later commanded by Major Walter Lane) did good service fighting the “guerrilleros” who attacked supply wagons traveling the Camargo-Monterrey road. Chief among their opponents was General Canales[^148] and a man known to the Texans as Juan Flores from Cerralvo, a town 71 miles north of Monterrey on the road to Mier.[^149]

On May 27, 1847 Lane’s company was sent to Cerralvo by General Taylor to find Juan Flores whose real name was José Nicolás Garcia. Two Mexican ranchers betrayed Garcia’s location and the Texans arrested Garcia at his home while he was in bed. The next day he was tried and sentenced to execution by firing squad. His execution was scheduled for the following day at noon in the plaza of Cerralvo. The Texas soldiers already had a reputation for atrocious behavior toward Mexican civilians and a group of passing American soldiers opposed the execution of Garcia.[^150] Colonel Alexander Doniphan’s Missouri regiment, recently discharged and on the way home, entered the town just prior to the execution and many of them protested, suspecting that Garcia was a victim of some injustice. The Missourian’s protests were ignored.

In June, about two months after Chevallie’s battalion arrived in Mexico, General Taylor, from his headquarters in Monterrey, dispatched Chevallié’s command to Linares.[^151] After three days of travel, Chevallie’s battalion and an observer, Lt. George T Shackleford of the US Sixth Infantry, reached Linares, 85 miles south of Monterrey, after nightfall. Believing that Mexican General José Urrea was camped in the city with a large Mexican force, Captain Lane dispatched three squads of ten men each to search the streets leading to the main plaza. The squad under 2nd Lt. Henry Earl encountered a mounted civilian, José María Arsipe, and ordered him to stop. According to the Texans he refused and Private John J. Glanton chased him down, shot and killed him. The Alcalde, Guillermo Morales, protested Arsipe’s murder[^152] but, as commanded, sent provisions and forage for the 300 Americans who camped at a ranch two miles from the city. The Texans remained at the ranch near Linares three or four days and then returned to Monterrey having found no armed Mexicans there.[^153]

### Rife’s unit was transferred to Saltillo in late 1847.

After Lane’s company returned to Monterrey, General Taylor ordered John Glanton arrested for killing the civilian in Linares. Glanton’s unit commander, Captain Lane, rather than arresting him, warned Glanton to flee.[^154] Later, John Glanton became a notorious murderer and subsequently killed many other Texans, Mexicans and Apaches in west Texas.[^155] For this infraction, Lane was placed under arrest for a few days and then released.[^156]

As a result of the trouble at Linares, Chevallie’s battalion was transferred to General John E. Wool’s command in Saltillo. The Texans were placed in a forward position called La Encantada, some fifteen miles south of Saltillo at the southern end of the valley where American and Mexican forces had fought the battle of Buena Vista the previous February.[^157] Rife’s unit remained at La Encantada (now called Agua Nueva) until February 29, 1848.[^158]

While Rife’s unit performed garrison duties in northern Mexico, Texas volunteers joined the US expeditionary force to fight in the Mexico City campaign. Colonel Hays raised a new regiment (also called 1st Regiment Texas Mounted Volunteers) that mustered in at San Antonio on July 10, 1847,[^159] On August 12, five companies of the regiment marched to Brazos de Santiago (now Point Isabel) where they were transported to Vera Cruz to join General Scott’s army.[^160] They arrived at the port of Vera Cruz in October, one month after the surrender of Mexico City.[^161] They ranged between Veracruz and Mexico City and operated under the personal orders of Brigadier General J. Lane.[^162]

While the Texas military organizations along the Mexico City-Veracruz road were guarding the supply line between Mexico City and Vera Cruz and earning fame while fighting off last-ditch efforts by Mexican partisans, Chevallie’s battalion continued to depredate on the civilian population around Saltillo. On July 21, 1847, five Texans attempted to rob a Mexican civilian on the road between La Encantada and Buena Vista. On August 16, 1847, General Wool learned that Texans had killed cattle and sheep in a ranch near San Juan de la Vaquería, southwest of Saltillo. General Wool issued General Order Number 405, warning that he would discharge the entire company if the perpetrators could not be identified.[^163]

### Walter P. Lane took command of the battalion.

On August 31, 1847, Major Chevallie resigned his commission after an altercation with General Wool and relinquished command of the battalion to Walter P. Lane.[^164] On September 27, 1847, an election was held by Companies A, B and C to select a new battalion commander to replace Chevallie.[^165] Of the 191 men who voted, 186 (including Thomas Rife) voted for Lane who was promoted to Major.[^166] On September 1, 1847, while Walter P. Lane was still the company commander, Thomas Rife was promoted to second sergeant of Company A.[^167]

Fighting continued after US troops captured Mexico City in September 1847. Jack Hays commanded a regiment at Perote castle near Puebla,[^168] When General Santa Anna attacked the US supply line to Veracruz after the fall of Mexico City, Samuel Walker, a former ranger captain, pursued Santa Anna’s troops and fought one of the last battles of the war at Huamantla.[^169]

Meanwhile, Rife’s unit continued its duties as an occupying force. In early September 1847, before Walter P. Lane was elected to command the battalion, Captain Lane’s company made a scout to Parras, about ninety miles west of Saltillo in the State of Coahuila.[^170] On October 16, Captain Taylor sent Lt. Simeon Nunelee to arrest the Alcalde of Yerba Buena. Unfortunately, the Texans killed four men while arresting the Alcalde. On November 25, 1847, an Irish civilian shot and killed Otto Peltz of Company A and one of the rangers responded by blowing the man’s brains out. Then the Texans “got on a spree and killed a few jackasses and bulldogs, and two Mexicans who had managed to get mixed up in the business.”[^171]

G. K. Lewis, elected from the ranks on October 19, 1847 to succeed Walter Lane as Captain of Company A,[^172] was no better at controlling his men than was Lane. Between April and September 1847, thirteen rangers were dishonorably discharged for stealing, killing or being “worthless” and thirty others deserted including thirteen who left La Encantada. Apparently, the Texans were not well suited to garrison duty.[^173]

Finally the advent of the Comanche raiding season gave the bored men something interesting to do. At 8 o’clock on the morning of November 21, 1847, pickets came to the battalion headquarters at La Encantada to report that a body of Comanche Indians had attacked a nearby village (possibly Carneros or Gómez Farias, about 20 miles south of Encantada or Agua Buena.)[^174] Lane mounted those of his men who had good horses and gave pursuit. During the pursuit many of the Texan’s horses gave out and they fell behind the main body. After riding hard for three hours, the remaining 60 to 80 rangers caught the Indians at a place called Los Muchachos, about fifteen miles west of Saltillo. Both groups formed a line of battle. The rangers charged the 120 to 300 Comanche warriors. After a running battle ranging over two miles the Indians dismounted and fled into the mountains.[^175] One ranger was killed and 14 wounded with 30 to 40 Indians killed and wounded. The rangers captured 300 mules and horses and six Mexican children kidnapped by the Indians earlier.[^176] Lane and his men returned to La Encantada but left the next day with the entire battalion to pursue Indians near Parras.[^177] Lane’s letter to Captain Nelson in Saltillo was printed in the Monterrey Gazette and widely reprinted in other newspapers.[^178] Rife was listed as “Lost in Action” on November 21st[^179] but he eventually returned to camp. He later stated that he was in the fight that day at Agua Buena.[^180]

On December 15, 1847, a squad of Captain Lewis’ Company of sixteen men, including Thomas Rife, were on a scout about 50 miles from Encantada at the Castañuela ranch (now La Rosa). They were eating a lunch of tortillas and coffee when they were alerted to the presence of some Comanche Indians nearby. They quickly emptied their quart-size cups of hot coffee and, accompanied by eight or nine Mexican men armed with lances, went out to meet the Indians. Both groups charged the other. The Indians had a few rifles but the soldier’s carbines outshot the arrows of the Indians who fled the field, leaving their dead behind. Captain Lewis was shot through the foot and one Texan was killed in the encounter.[^181]

On February 2, 1848, US and Mexican diplomats signed a treaty in a suburb of Mexico City called Guadalupe Hidalgo and agreed to an armistice to begin March 5.[^182] Jacks Hay’s regiment of Texas volunteers was mustered out at Vera Cruz and were on hand to watch ex-President Santa Anna depart Mexico for exile in Jamaica in April.[^183] On June 12, 1848, the last US troops left Mexico City.[^184]

### Rife’s unit was detailed to occupy the road to Zacatecas in February 1848.

The armistice did not require American forces to evacuate Mexico and the occupation of northern Mexico continued. On February 28, 1848, Companies D and E of Lane’s battalion and the 2nd Mississippi Regiment were sent to the town of Mazapil some 95 miles south of Saltillo, located in the northern part of the State of Zacatecas in the Chihuahuan Desert.[^185] The Americans arrived March 7 and established their headquarters at Cedras, just west of Mazapil on the old Zacatecas-Saltillo road.[^186] During March and April 1848, Rife’s unit (Company A) was stationed at the market town of Gruñidora about 60 miles south of Mazapil on the road to Zacatecas city.[^187] Company B remained at the battalion’s old camp near Buena Vista and Company C, commanded by Captain George Adams was stationed at Parras.[^188]

On March 12, 1848, Major Lane, Captain John Pope of the US Army Topographical Engineers, and fourteen rangers (Walter Lane remembered 40 rangers[^189] departed Mazapil on a reconnaissance across cactus and mesquite country toward Matehuala in the State of San Luis Potosí, some 90 miles to the southeast of Mazapil. The soldiers stopped at the farming village of Salado and entered the small town of Cedral (five miles north of Matehuala) on the morning of March 14. In Cedral they stopped in empty army barracks for a few hours to eat and rest.[^190] Hostile Mexican civilians soon surrounded the building but the Americans bluffed their way out of town without having to use their firearms. The scout returned to Mazapil on March 16 having traveled 225 miles in four days.[^191]

On May 2, 1848 Lt. William H. Francis, John E. Dusenberry and nine other rangers left their station at Concepción del Oro (five miles east of Mazapil) and returned to the village of Salado to exhume the remains of the seventeen prisoners of the Mier Expedition who were executed there in 1843. This action was undertaken at the initiative of the rangers involved. Dusenberry (and a private in his company) later escorted the remains to La Grange in Fayette County, Texas where local residents buried them on a bluff overlooking the Colorado River.[^192] In later years the State of Texas constructed a monument over the remains. A newspaper in San Antonio reported that Rife was one of the men who exhumed the bones but there is no other evidence to support this.[^193] The unit commander, Walter P. Lane, made a similar, unsupported claim that he too was personally involved in recovering the bones.[^194]

### Rife’s unit disbanded in June 1848.

On June 12, 1848, General Wool announced to his troops that the war was over; the US Army began preparations to withdraw from northern Mexico.[^195] The soldiers stationed in Saltillo and points west returned to Monterrey, General Wool's headquarters. Lane’s battalion camped at Walnut Springs, two miles distant from town[^196] in the same place that they had camped prior to the Battle of Monterrey in 1846. Most of the soldiers were given leave to visit the city. When the US Army of Occupation left Monterrey for Camargo, Lane’s battalion formed the rearguard, considered as a position of honor.[^197]

On June 30, 1848, the army was disbanded at Camargo City[^198] and the men mustered out of Federal service.[^199] Clay Davis, the owner of the growing town of Rio Grande City (across the river from Camargo city), invited Major Lane and his discharged rangers to attend a fourth of July public dinner at the Rio Grande Hotel.[^200] Most of the volunteer infantry then went to Matamoros where vessels waited to take them to New Orleans or Galveston while the Texas mounted troops returned to Texas on horseback.[^201]
