## South Carolina

### Swiss Protestants immigrated to South Carolina.

King Charles II of England granted the Province of Carolina to the Lords Proprietors in 1663 as a business enterprise. The eight English royalists founded Charles Town in 1680 as their new colony’s center of trade and culture and the port of entry. The new colony attracted a number of settlers who farmed on the rich coastal plain in the vicinity of Charles Town. In 1733, the South Carolina General Assembly established eleven townships along major rivers of the coastal plain to encourage immigration to the interior of the province.[^1] Among these new townships were Orangeburg and Saxe-Gotha.[^2]

The first Swiss Protestants to arrive in South Carolina settled around Orangeburg in 1735. Two years later, Swiss settlers arrived in Saxe-Gotha. Before the Swiss arrived, the region was a wilderness with only four or five English residents.[^3] The government of England encouraged immigration of protestants to the Carolinas and provided settlers with 50-acres of free land and a subsidy of twenty Pounds Sterling.[^4] A letter written by John Peter Purry in 1735 and cosigned by a dozen German-speaking residents of the Saxe-Gotha Township, was distributed in Switzerland to encourage migration to the township.[^5]

Partly as a result of the letter and the inducements offered by the British Crown, large numbers of Palatines (German-speaking Swiss Protestants) settled in Orangeburg, Congaree and Wateree Districts between 1740 and 1755.[^6] Between 1732 and 1744 at least eleven ships arrived in the Carolinas carrying Swiss immigrants. As late as 1765, six hundred refugee Protestants from two districts of south Germany and Switzerland (Palatine and Swabia) were sent from London to the townships in South Carolina set aside for them.[^7] It is likely that the ancestor of Thomas Rife settled in South Carolina during this period.[^8]

### Saxe-Gotha Township was the frontier of European settlement.

During the Cherokee War of 1759-1761, many of the settlers in Saxe-Gotha Township fled for safety to the towns of Ebenezer and Savannah in the colony of Georgia and to Charles Town and Purrysburg (a settlement on the coast) in South Carolina.[^9] Some of the Swiss settlers never returned to their homes in Saxe-Gotha. Some were killed during the war and others moved north to Pennsylvania where conditions were safer with established schools and churches.[^10]

After their defeat, the Cherokee ceded some of their lands east of the Blue Ridge Mountains to the settlers and moved their towns further west.[^11] This opened a large area of land in the Piedmont Plateau and the adjacent low country that attracted land speculators and settlers from existing settlements to the north of South Carolina. During the French and Indian Wars, settlers from Virginia began moving south looking for cheap and secure land.[^12] A fork on the Great Wagon Road crossed the northern part of Saxe-Gotha Township; Scots-Irish families from Virginia and Pennsylvania settled in the district in the generation just prior to the American Revolution.[^13]

### Conrod Rife and Peter Chambliss fought in the Revolutionary War.

As a result of conflicts over taxes and governance, a revolutionary government was established in Charles Town in 1775. Although many Carolinians still supported the British Crown, the Royal Governor left the colony and South Carolina declared itself an independent state on July 4, 1776. Events in the Northern colonies soon led to the American Revolution.[^14]

In June 1775, Conrod Rife enlisted in Captain Field Farrer’s Company of state troops at Ninety-Six Court House.[^15] The company became one of ten companies of the 3rd Regiment of the South Carolina Line.[^16] The 3rd Regiment consisted of volunteer, mounted riflemen who were not militiamen. The regiment was mustered into the Continental Army (known in those days as the Continental Establishment) in September 1776 [^17] and fought at the Sieges of Savannah and Charles Town. The entire 3rd Regiment, including Farrer’s company, was captured in May of 1780 at Charles Town when the city surrendered to a British invasion force. After its capture, the regiment of 259 men was disbanded in January 1781 [^18] before Rife’s term of enlistment expired.[^19]

After the 3rd Regiment surrendered, the enlisted men were paroled and then exchanged. Many subsequently joined other regiments.[^20] Conrod Rife appeared on the roll of Captain Philemon Waters’ Company, 1st Spartan Regiment of Militia (Light Dragoons) soon after the 3rd Regiment disbanded.[^21] Conrad’s Compiled Military Service Record states that he served for 46 months and 21 days between August 10, 1777 and July 1, 1781.[^22]

In 1780, Peter Chambliss lived in Camden District, South Carolina, upstream of Saxe-Gotha Township. He enlisted in the 5th Regiment, South Carolina Line during the Revolutionary War and served from 1778 until 1781.[^23]

The British army and its Tory militia marched towards Virginia where they launched an unsuccessful invasion of the middle Atlantic colonies. Eventually the British army surrendered at Yorktown, Virginia in October 1781 and the last British troops left Charles Town in December 1782.[^24]

### Peter Chambliss married the widow Rife.

Conrod Rife was listed in the 1790 Federal Census as living alone with one slave on a farm near Sandy Run in the Orangeburg District.[^25] Sandy Run is a stream about eleven miles south of the Fall Line on the Santee/Congaree River in the old Saxe-Gotha Township. The Census does not clearly show the location of Rife’s farm but its location was determined by comparing names in the 1790 and 1800 Federal Census. In 1800, the twenty families living along Sandy Run were a German-speaking community of 119 adult men, 101 adult women, 260 children and 107 slaves.[^26]

In 1800, Mary Rife was enumerated as living on the farm near Sandy Run in Lexington County, Orangeburg District that Conrod Rife occupied in 1790. She was listed as a widow with four children and two slaves; two boys and a girl less than ten years of age and one girl described as 10-15 years old. Family genealogies list the two boys as William, born in 1795, and Jacob, born in 1798. No record of Conrod Rife exists after 1790, so it is presumed that he died before 1800.

In March 23, 1801, Polly (Mary) Rife claimed 67 acres of land in the Congaree Swamp above Beaver Creek.[^27]  This may have been a land grant based on her husband’s Revolutionary War service.[^28]

Peter Chambliss also received a land grant as a Revolutionary War veteran.[^29] In the 1800 Federal Census, he was enumerated in Lexington County on the Edisto River not far from the Rife farm on Sandy Run.[^30] He was married, had two sons (Peter Corbin, aged 10 and John, aged 8), a girl (Elizabeth, aged 4) and three slaves. His wife was probably Mary Elizabeth Corbin who was born in 1771 and died in 1798.[^31] By the date the census was taken, he may have been courting his third wife, the widow Mary Rife.

## Louisiana and Mississippi

### Peter Chambliss joined the migration from the Carolinas to the Mississippi Territory.

As more settlers cleared land in the Up Country, (the Piedmont region above the Fall Line) the Santee, Congaree and Wateree Rivers began to flood in the spring and run low in the summer. Poor farming methods and spring floods caused extensive erosion in the Up Country of South Carolina and low water in the Low Country. The fluctuating river level damaged rice plantations on the lower Santee River where there was a large community of French-speaking planters. Typically, the Upland settlers were not producing any crops for export; before 1800, they marketed beef, pork, staves and shingles.[^32] After the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, most farmers began to export cotton, although rice continued to be planted in the Low Country along the Atlantic coast.[^33] The success of cotton profoundly changed the South. Cotton became the dominant crop and its success encouraged many farmers to migrate westward to the Mississippi Territory seeking better land.[^34]

Peter Chambliss and his family were first enumerated in the Mississippi Territory in 1805. Eight children were living at home in addition to 10 slaves.[^35] Jefferson County Tax Records show that $11.90 in taxes was paid on 440 acres in 1807.[^36] The two Rife girls had already married and left their parent’s home. William Rife’s half-sister Elizabeth married in 1813 and his half-brother Peter C. married in 1815.[^37] These were the oldest of the Chambliss children and they were the first to marry and leave home.

### The children of Peter Chambliss left Jefferson County.

When Peter Chambliss moved to southwestern Mississippi, the First Choctaw Session was the only US-held territory west of Georgia that did not belong to one of the Indian Nations. Greenville City was a new American settlement and the county seat of Jefferson County. The nearest established market towns were Natchez to the south and Port Gibson to the north.[^38]

Americans continued to arrive in such large numbers that by 1830 many planters came to believe that there was no longer enough available land in southwestern Mississippi to accommodate the next generation. Many left the area in groups of related families seeking new land elsewhere. After Peter Chambliss died in 1828, most of his sons and stepsons moved north up the Mississippi River to the wilderness that became Carroll Parish, Louisiana. The oldest son, Peter Corbin Chambliss, inherited the family farm in Jefferson County and stayed in Mississippi. Another son, Samuel, returned to Jefferson County from Carroll Parish after 1836 and farmed in Jefferson County until at least 1850 when he returned to Carroll Parish.[^39] The younger sons of Peter Chambliss all moved to Lake Providence before 1834.

### William Rife and his wife were the first of the Chambliss family to move to Lake Providence.

When William Rife was 17-years old he left home briefly to serve with the Territorial Militia during the War of 1812 as a Private in Col. Peter Perkin’s 7th Regiment.[^40] He returned to his stepfather’s farm in Jefferson County after the war ended and appeared as an unmarried head of household with 2 slaves (and no land) on the tax rolls for 1817.[^41] On October 28, 1819, when he was 24-years old, William Rife married Martha Jane Collins (who was born about 1805 in Kentucky) in Jefferson County, Mississippi.[^42] In 1820 he and his wife were living near Greenville City with two slaves (a man and a woman). He was a farmer as were most of his neighbors.[^43]

William Rife did not appear on the tax rolls for 1821 because he had left Jefferson County and moved his family to Lake Providence in northeastern Louisiana. In 1823, William and Martha Jane Rife’s first child, Thomas, was born in Ouachita Parish, Louisiana.[^44] William Rife lived on this farm on Lake Providence for less than eight years. In the 1830 census, his family was enumerated in the Princeton neighborhood of Washington County, Mississippi, across the river from Ouachita Parish, Louisiana.[^45]

The family remained on the farm in Washington County until William passed away. The last of William and Martha’s four children, William W. Rife Jr., was born in 1838.[^46] In 1840 William Sr. patented land in neighboring Bolivar County but there is no evidence that he lived there.[^47]

In January 1842 the older of the two daughters of William and Martha Rife, Mary Jane, married Lawrence Thompson Wade. He was a younger son in a large family that had recently arrived from South Carolina by way of Tennessee. Lacking capital to purchase their own farms, Lawrence Wade and his brothers found employment as slave overseers.[^48] Many white men who worked as slave overseers found themselves at the bottom of the social scale of white society[^49] but for many others, including Lawrence Wade, it was a temporary job preparing them to own and manage their own plantations. When William Rife died in 1843 or 1844, Lawrence became the surrogate father and guardian of Rife’s widow and their children. William Jr. and Martha had an inheritance from their uncle Robert J. Chambliss and Lawrence Wade was appointed to be their “tutor”.[^50]

When William Rife Sr. passed away, he was buried near the present town of Greenville, Mississippi.[^51] His death left no adult white men on the farm. William’s brother, Jacob, had returned to South Carolina prior to 1840[^52] and the oldest son, Thomas, left home for Texas prior to 1838.[^53] William’s widow and her remaining unmarried daughter moved into her son-in-law’s home in Carroll Parish.

### The children of William Rife moved to Issaquena County, Mississippi.

Martha Jane Rife, William’s widow, died in Carroll Parish in 1853, probably in the home of Lawrence Wade, her son-in-law and guardian.[^54] In May 1853, her remaining unmarried daughter, Martha Ann, married William Sibley. He was a descendant of Richard Albritton of South Carolina and hailed from the locally famous Sibley family that had moved en masse to far western Louisiana between 1835 and 1837.

Like the Sibley family, William Rife and his siblings left southwestern Mississippi because they believed there was not enough land for them.[^55] William W. Rife Jr. returned from school to the village of Providence in 1855[^56] and by 1860 was employed as the Deputy Court Recorder at the Carroll Parish Courthouse in the village of Floyd.[^57]

### Nathaniel and Samuel Chambliss grew up in Louisiana and Mississippi.

In 1823 William Rife’s first son, Thomas Collins Rife, was born near the village of Lake Providence in what is today East Carroll Parish, Louisiana.[^58] The settlement at Lake Providence was located on the natural levee on the south bank of Lake Providence, an ox-bow lake,  about eight miles west of the Mississippi River. When William Rife moved his family there, it was new country and a wilderness but by 1848 there were as many as twenty-five large cotton plantations within three miles of the village.[^59] The flat, low-lying and often flooded land was ideally suited to growing cotton.[^60]

Although most of the sons of Peter Chambliss eventually followed William Rife to what became Carroll Parish, William did not remain there. Driven again, perhaps by the haunting promise of new country, he moved his family back across the Mississippi River to the wilderness of the Mississippi Delta. The family’s new home was about thirty miles upstream of Lake Providence. Fast and easy transportation provided by Mississippi River steamboats enabled the family to maintain close connections with their relatives in Carroll Parish. Nathaniel and Samuel Chambliss had moved to Carroll Parish and they and most of their brothers established plantations there. These two men were half-brothers of Thomas Rife’s father.


## The Republic of Texas

### Nathaniel and Samuel Chambliss influenced Thomas Rife to go to Texas.

The westward movement of planters continued into the next generation when a number of Rife, Chambliss, Wade and Sibley descendants moved to Texas to the agricultural limits of the Cotton Kingdom.[^61] Two uncles of Thomas Rife (Nathaniel and Samuel Chambliss) and one aunt (Martha Bell) went to Texas. Another died in Texas in 1864 as a refugee during the Civil War. At least four children of Peter Chambliss moved to Texas. With the exception of Nathaniel Chambliss, these families moved to Texas after the Civil War when there was a general movement of impoverished planters from the Old South.[^62] Like most settlers of this period, they went to Texas as economic refugees and land speculators.

The fifth child of Peter Chambliss was Nathaniel Chambliss, born in 1802 in South Carolina. Samuel Lee Chambliss was the tenth child in the family. He was a volunteer soldier in the Texas war for independence in 1836. After the Texas war, he lived in Louisiana and Mississippi for a time then returned to Texas in 1867 and died in Navarro County, Texas in 1876. His experience in Texas undoubtedly influenced his older brother Nathaniel and his young nephew, Thomas Rife, as well as other men, to move to Texas.

### Samuel Chambliss joined the fight for Texas independence.

After the Texas revolution began in 1836, hundreds of young men from the American states rushed to Texas to join the fight. American volunteers formed the majority of the Texas army[^63] and probably only twenty percent of the men of the Texas army that fought at San Jacinto were residents of Texas. The other soldiers were young men who came to Texas to “fight for their country”.[^64] One of these men was Tom Rife’s uncle, Samuel Lee Chambliss.

On November 15, 1835 Samuel Chambliss helped to raise and equip a volunteer militia company in Carroll Parish to fight with Texas Federalists against Mexican Centralists led by General Santa Anna. Samuel and his friends in Carroll Parish raised over $5,000 to equip the company for the campaign. The company of 124 men traveled overland to Washington-on-the-Brazos; soon to be the seat of government of the new Republic of Texas. After the company arrived at Washington-on-the-Brazos, its original commander returned to Louisiana and the company was reorganized with Samuel Chambliss in command.[^65]

In February 1836 Samuel’s company, along with that of Capt. Samuel Williams, was sent in pursuit of a band of Indians who were raiding American settlements east of the Trinity River. The Indians were overtaken near a place called Comanche Peak (in present-day Johnson County) and escaped after a running fight over several miles.

During the fight, Samuel was wounded in his right arm. His companions removed the arrowhead or barb but he could not use his arm and could not continue the pursuit.[^66] Chambliss’ company was disbanded soon afterward for a “want of provisions and let loose in order to scatter and get subsistence”.[^67] Chambliss stated that, “In April 1836, the grass gave out, the horses became unfit for such service and I disbanded the company”.[^68] Samuel then went to Gross’ (or Groce’s) plantation on the Brazos River to offer his services to Sam Houston, commander of the Texas army. Chambliss was assigned to deliver General Houston’s mail and dispatches to US General Gaines at Fort Jessup near present-day Many, Louisiana.[^69]

While he was at Fort Jessup, a musket ball was removed from Chambliss’ thigh. He had been wounded in a fight on the Upper Colorado River a month or two before. He was then ordered by General Houston to go to Vicksburg, Mississippi to deliver messages and to raise a battalion of cavalry. Subsequently, Houston asked Chambliss to encourage men to come to Texas as settlers. Towards that end, in the late summer and fall of 1836, Chambliss delivered speeches before gatherings in Jefferson, Warren and Claiborne Counties in Mississippi to encourage farmers to move to Texas.[^70]

### Samuel Chambliss returned to the United States after the Texas Revolution.

Samuel was furloughed from the Texas army at Nacogdoches in October 1836[^71] along with the majority of the army.[^72] He received a discharge paper that he lost in 1862 or 1863 when, according to Chambliss, “our house in Louisiana was broken into by force by the Federal Army and said Discharge and letters with my library were destroyed”.[^73] In the fall of 1836, Samuel Chambliss returned to Carroll Parish where he recovered from his wounds.[^74] He then returned to Jefferson County, Mississippi where he may have inherited land.  He and Jane T. Scott had married in 1833. They settled down to raise a family and to operate a plantation, growing cotton with ten slave laborers.[^75] By 1860 he owned 116 slaves and was living in Carroll Parish.[^76]

Samuel told war stories to friends and family upon his return home. His audience included his older brother, Nathaniel, and his nephew, Tom Rife. Samuel must have extolled the agricultural potential of Washington County, Texas; an area with which he was familiar. The availability of good, cheap land influenced his brother Nathaniel to move to Texas in 1838. Nathaniel had already outlived two wives and may have been seeking a healthier climate. Like many other farmers, he may have been escaping financial trouble caused by the Panic of 1837. Young Tom, who never wanted to be a farmer, may have been attracted by the prospect of war and Indian fights.

### Farmers from the Old South immigrated to Texas after 1836.

There were three principal routes leading to Texas in 1838. Perhaps the most common was by ship from New Orleans via the Gulf of Mexico to Galveston or a landing on the Gulf coast.[^77] The usual overland route was by steamer up the Red River to Natchitoches and then along the Old Spanish or San Antonio Road (El Camino Real) through to Nacogdoches in Texas.[^78] Settlers traveling this road passed through the largely uninhabited Neutral Ground in western Louisiana, crossed the Sabine River at Gain’s Ferry and passed through the villages of San Augustine and Nacogdoches. There they bought corn from already established farmers.[^79]  The best route for wagons was said to be through San Augustine, Nacogdoches, Washington-on-the-Brazos, and Columbus and then on to the Lavaca River and Spring Hill.[^80] Samuel Chambliss was familiar with the Old Spanish Road and he probably recommended that route to Nathaniel as the safest and easiest way to reach Texas. A third, less commonly used route, the Opelousas Road, went overland through southwestern Louisiana.[^81]

Large numbers of emigrants traveled overland to Texas after the battle of San Jacinto in ox-carts, in wagons, on foot and on horseback. Many were encouraged to immigrate to Texas between 1837 and 1841 with the promise of a 640-acre head-right. Prior to the American Revolution, some British colonies on the Atlantic coast offered a head-right of either fifty or 100 acres, either to the immigrant himself or the immigrant’s sponsor.[^82] After the American Revolution all land west of the thirteen original states became the property of the Federal government, which did not continue the practice of giving a head-right to new arrivals to its territories. Most prospective Texas settlers came from states or territories that offered settlers no free land other than soldier’s bounties.[^83]

A growing number of farmers in the southern states were in search of better, cheaper land[^84] and Texas river bottomland was known to be fertile and suitable for cotton.[^85]  Men such as Samuel Chambliss, who had traveled to Texas during the Texas War for Independence, spoke impressively of the agricultural potential of the Republic. What attracted their attention were the board river valleys of the Sabine, Neches, Trinity, Brazos and the Colorado Rivers.[^86]

The Texas Congress levied few taxes and financed government operations by issuing government paper and land certificates.[^87] As a result, land certificates were cheap and plentiful.[^88] A land certificate, whether it was soldier’s scrip or a head-right, gave the holder the right to claim a given amount of vacant land anywhere in the public domain. Since the high cost of locating, surveying and patenting the land had to be paid by the prospective settler before he could receive title,[^89] many new emigrants found it advantageous to rent or to lease land from speculators rather than making a land claim based a land certificate.[^90]

### Nathaniel Chambliss settled in Washington County in 1838.

It is unclear when Thomas Rife came to Texas. He may have accompanied his uncle, Nathaniel Chambliss, when Nathaniel moved from Carroll Parish to Washington County, Texas in 1838.[^91] There was a great deal of migration to Texas immediately after becoming a republic although the pace of new arrivals slowed following the Panic of 1837.[^92]  The Panic was followed by a lengthy recession that affected Texas as well as the United States and cotton prices fell by 50%, bankrupting many businesses, including planters.

It was said that the same qualities of daring, bravery, reckless abandon and heavy self-assertiveness that motivated a man to go to Texas also fitted him to conquer the wilderness.[^93] According to Noah Smithwick, who lived in San Felipe during this period, many of the men who came to Texas during the Republic were fleeing their past.[^94] Some were bankrupts, murderers or adulterers who came to Texas to escape the reach of the law. In the United States bankrupt individuals were sent to jail, while in Texas they were safe from United States criminal and bankruptcy law. Most people in Louisiana and elsewhere assumed that immigrants to Texas during this period were either villains or desperate men.[^95]

Many of the young men who came to Texas were simply looking for adventure and excitement.[^96] While young Thomas Rife fit this description, Nathaniel Chambliss did not. He was an older man accustomed to owning and managing property. He was married and well established in his community.[^97] He was a planter who was drawn to the opportunities presented by the opening of Texas to American settlement. The land in Washington County that bordered the creeks was considered among the best agricultural land in Texas[^98] and that is where Nathanial Chambliss settled.

### Thomas Rife arrived in east Texas before 1842.

Before leaving Louisiana, Nathaniel, on May 13, 1838, married his third wife, Caroline Hale, who was twenty years his junior.[^99] Between June 1838 and May 23, 1839, Nathaniel and his entourage arrived in Washington County.[^100] William Lytle, a blacksmith, arrived in Washington-on-the-Brazos from Tennessee with his wife and son Samuel on December 15, 1838[^101] and eleven-year-old Samuel Lytle met Tom Rife in 1842.[^102] Their paths crossed many times over the course of their long lives in southwest Texas.

Nathaniel probably rented land for his first two years in Texas. New arrivals to Texas after March 2, 1836 rented land because “original Texians” (those who resided in the Republic on the date of the Declaration of Independence) had preference in the matter of locating their head-rights.[^103]  On February 11, 1840 Nathaniel bought 840 acres for the sum of $2,000 from John Lott, an early settler.[^104] This land, on New Years Creek in Washington County, was part of the Mexican land grant of Samuel R. Miller.[^105] Nathaniel paid $2.38 per acre for what must have been a working farm. It was in the Brazos watershed and was considered some of the richest agricultural land in the State.[^106] The farm was a mix of undeveloped woodland and prairie with a small cleared field and a cabin.

### Nathaniel Chambliss was a man of means.

Nathaniel and Caroline’s new home was two miles from Chappell Hill and six miles from both Washington and Independence.[^107] The village of Washington was, at that time, the seat of government of the Republic. His oldest daughter, Mary Rutledge, stated that she often rode behind her father in 1843 into Washington on horseback.[^108] Chambliss was a man who shouldered his responsibilities to his neighbors and served wherever he was needed to maintain a civil society in Texas.[^109] Mary, in 1919, wrote, “Our home was the rendezvous of many of our great men. Among the number were Houston, Rusk, Burleson, Wharton, Lamar and others well known at that time…”.[^110] As time would tell, Nathaniel was not a successful land speculator.

A provision of an act of the Congress of the Republic of Texas on January 4, 1839 extended donations of land to Late Emigrants (emigrants who arrived in Texas after the establishment of the Republic). Nathaniel Chambliss was granted, on May 23, 1839, a Class 3 Conditional Certificate for 640-acres of vacant land as the head of a household who arrived in Texas between October 1, 1837 but before January 1, 1840.[^111] He received Certificate No. 104.[^112]

The tax rolls of 1840 suggest that Nathaniel was a man of means. He owned a carriage, a clock and four slaves, all taxable luxuries at that time.[^113] Although the records are incomplete, tax rolls from 1840 show only forty carriages in the Republic with twenty-two owned by individuals in Washington County.[^114] Chambliss paid a tax of  $4 for his carriage as well as the tax on four slaves.[^115]

### The war with Mexico began again in 1842.

In March of 1842 the Republic of Texas was again at war with Mexico.[^116] Texas President Sam Houston, despite the opposition of Congress, sent a military expedition to Santa Fé in Mexican-held New Mexico.[^117]  Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna responded by sending a similar expedition to west Texas.[^118] On March 5-7, 700 Mexican soldiers under General Rafael Vásquez occupied San Antonio.[^119] In response to this invasion, Nathaniel Chambliss joined Capt. Samuel Bogart’s Company of the Southwestern Army of the Republic of Texas, 1st Regiment.[^120]

On June 3, 1843, Moses Park was given a Power-of-Attorney to act as Nathaniel’s agent at the county seat of Mt. Vernon during Nathaniel’s absence from the Republic.[^121] Many prudent Texans left the region west of the Colorado River during this period. East Texas, including Washington County, was considered quite safe from any Mexican invasion force.[^122] Nathaniel may have returned to the neighborhood of Lake Providence to manage his affairs there since he patented land at the Ouachita Land Office as late as 1846, ten years after he moved to Texas.

Nathaniel Chambliss served as a trustee for his church and road overseer for the precinct where he lived.[^123] Nathaniel was a Methodist.[^124] and a trustee of the Cedar Creek Methodist Church. He was instrumental in creating the Methodist camp at Cedar Creek.[^125] The Second Great Awakening was in full swing in Texas by the 1840’s and highly emotional camp meetings were a regular feature of religious life on the frontier.[^126] Camp meetings met the social, as well as the religious, needs of the isolated population and were a convenient time for many people to be baptized and to visit distant neighbors.[^127] Preachers riding a circuit helped alleviate the shortage of resident pastors. Methodist and Baptist churches grew rapidly and were the focus of community life in the first half of the 19th Century.[^128]

A bill enacted in 1841 laid out procedures to swear, with witnesses, to the continued residence of conditional land certificate holders for the purpose of converting conditional certificates to unconditional certificates.[^129] Nathaniel’s Class 3 Certificate granted on May 23, 1838 required a three-year residence in Texas before it could be deemed unconditional. Nathaniel Chambliss completed the residence requirement and was issued an Unconditional Certificate in Washington County for 640 acres of land on February 26, 1849.[^130]

### Nathaniel Chambliss moved his family to Lavaca County.

Before 1850 Nathaniel Chambliss sold his farm in Washington County and moved to Lavaca County.[^131] He continued to serve in public office and prospered after his move to Lavaca County. In 1851 he received his long delayed pay for military service during the Vásquez campaign of 1842[^132] and in the spring of 1853 he registered a cattle brand and purchased a cotton gin.[^133] The following year he used his head-right certificate to patent 640 acres in Erath County 250 miles from his home.[^134] He probably never visited the land[^135] and it was sold at auction after his death.[^136]

In August 1852 Nathaniel was elected to the Lavaca County Commissioners Court where first duty was to settle a dispute involving an election to pick the location of the county seat.[^137] Such elections were always hard fought and often fraudulent.[^138] The presence of a courthouse usually guaranteed that a town would thrive at the expense of other, nearby villages in the same county.[^139] Although the town of Hallettsville received the majority of votes cast, the people of Petersburg (a village in the Zumwalt Settlement that no longer exists) contested the election. Eventually an armed posse was sent to Petersberg to secure the county records for the town of Hallettsville.[^140]

A June 15, 1858 newspaper story about Lavaca County mentioned that Dr. Chambliss planted a field of twenty-acres in a variety of maize called Peabody Corn. The article asserted that this variety would yield at least 100 bushels of corn to the acre.[^141] Nathaniel was apparently an innovative farmer willing to risk planting new crop varieties. This article called him “Doctor Chambliss,” a title he used in later life. The title was honorary and there is no evidence that he received formal training in or even practiced medicine.[^142]

In the Census of 1860 only Nathaniel, his wife and their 16-year-old son remained at home.[^143] His two daughters married in 1856 and 1858.[^144] While Nathaniel from all appearances was a wealthy man, he was in reality deeply in debt. On May 16, 1859 his financial condition worsened. He was forced to mortgage 751 acres, all cotton produced on the land and the fifteen slaves who worked the fields to Tarleton, Whiting and Tullis, a New Orleans firm of cotton buyers or factors.[^145] Two years later on March 19, 1861 he took out a second mortgage on one of these tracts (320 acres and 4 slaves) from Josiah Dowling, a local resident and acquaintance of Chambliss, for $2,218.47.[^146] The coming Civil War bankrupted most Southern planters and Nathaniel was unable to pay back the money he had borrowed.


## The Civil War

### Nathaniel Chambliss supported the Rebellion.

In response to a call for a County Convention, a meeting was called on November 21, 1860 in Hallettsville to vote on the issue of secession from the Union. Abraham Lincoln, a man who many southerners suspected was an abolitionist, had just become President-Elect of the United States. Five hundred people attended the convention and heard speeches by six men including Nathaniel’s son-in-law, Benjamin F. Fly, an attorney. A resolution supporting secession was read and unanimously adopted.[^147] Delegates were elected to a Secession Convention in Austin and on February 1, 1861 Texas seceded from the Union. Two state military units were organized in Lavaca County on June 6, 1861. Oliver Searcy’s company included Samuel. L. Chambliss (Nathaniel’s only son) and S. Hudspeth (probably the brother of Nathaniel’s son-in-law) as privates.[^148]

On February 14, 1862 Nathaniel’s seventeen-year-old son enlisted in a company commanded by his brother-in-law Benjamin Fly. This company was attached to the 24th Texas Cavalry Regiment. Samuel L. Chambliss was captured twice and, having violated his parole, was sent to Rock Island Barracks, Illinois where he died as a prisoner-of-war on August 8, 1864.[^149] Captain Benjamin Fly (Mary Rutledge Chambliss’ husband) was captured on January 11, 1863 and paroled on April 25, 1863 at Fort Delaware, Delaware.

In May 1862 Nathaniel Chambliss was about 60 years old and exempt from military service.[^150] Nevertheless he did what he could for the war effort. The Lavaca County Commissioners Court appointed three men in each Beat or Precinct to examine the condition of indigent families of absent soldiers. Nathaniel was one of these relief commissioners.[^151] In the beginning county aid was extended to 45 families. In September at least 100 families of absent soldiers were in need of clothing. In the January term the county commissioners were authorized to purchase clothe made in the penitentiary at Huntsville to supply these families with clothing. In the May term the Court levied a tax of 35 cents to be assessed on each $100.00 worth of property for the support of needy families. Nathaniel, his wife and daughters contributed a total of $50 to a hospital fund and some of the ladies made socks and caps to be sold to the government and the money put into the hospital fund.[^152]

To provide relief to soldier’s wives, the Commissioner’s Court remitted delinquent taxes on property of Confederate soldiers. Taxes could also be paid with produce at a value of 50 cents a bushel for corn, 12½ cents for a pound of bacon and 10 cents per pound of cotton. The county’s cotton was carried to Mexico and sold.[^153] By 1865, prices of clothing and foodstuff were so high and the county’s credit so low that the county relief program was abandoned. Thereafter, indigent families had to depend on their own gardens for food and on their neighbors for charity.

As the Federal blockade of the Southern ports became more effective, manufactured goods from abroad became scarce. Soldiers in the field depended more and more on those at home for supplies, especially clothing.[^154] The women of Lavaca County worked to clean and card wool to make thread, spin yarn, weave cloth and make items of clothing that were then shipped to company headquarters for distribution to the men in the army.[^155]

In Carroll Parish, Louisiana, Nathaniel’s brother, Samuel Lee Chambliss, was appointed Lieutenant Colonel of the 13th Battalion, Louisiana Partisan Rangers in October 1862.[^156] He resigned his commission in April 1863 due to infirmity and “advanced age” although he was only 48 years old. He was examined by a physician and found to be suffering from emaciation and debility due to “exposure during the past winter.”[^157] Most of the plantations around Lake Providence were abandoned by the spring of 1863. In the spring of 1863 Confederate or Federal troops broke into Samuel’s house in Carroll Parish and destroyed his library.[^158]

### After the War many parts of the Old South were in chaos.

The Civil War completely disrupted life in Carroll Parish. Conflict between the US Army, freedmen and unrepentant ex-Confederates made life increasingly dangerous and troublesome in parts of Louisiana and Texas.[^159] The Mississippi River levee was breached and the whole region was flooded.[^160] The Parish was overrun by both Federal and Confederate troops[^161] and later became a training base for freedmen who enlisted in the US Army.[^162] The Army confiscated farms and placed them in the hands of freedmen under the supervision of Federal officials.[^163]

Taxes increased[^164] and the price of the region’s main commodity, cotton, began a slow decline that continued for the next fifty years.[^165] In a letter to his uncle Jacob Rife (William Rife’s brother in South Carolina), Lawrence Wade stated “I have lost all the money I had at the close of the war experimenting with freedman labor...We are the poorest people you ever saw and getting worse every day”.[^166] Most white families fled the area either during or after the War[^167] and by 1866 the three younger Rife children had all moved from Louisiana to Issaquena County in the Mississippi Delta.[^168] William Sibley and his wife and family also moved to Issaquena County where  Martha Ann died in 1865.

In 1869 William Rife Jr. moved fifty miles north to Bolivar County and purchased part of the former plantation of General Vick near the village of Bolivar. In 1870 Lawrence Wade, his wife and four children were still in Issaquena County but by 1873 he had moved to the 500-acre former Vick plantation where he partnered with his brother-in-law, William Rife, Junior.[^169]

Lawrence Wade died in 1875 and his widow died in 1888. Both are buried in Bolivar Mississippi on the former Vick plantation, which they called “Wadelawn”.[^170] Her younger brother, William Rife Jr. never married. He became a wealthy planter and respected businessman who maintained a close relationship with his sister Martha Ann and her husband.[^171] He also stayed in contact with his older brother, Thomas, who lived in Texas.[^172] William Rife Jr. died on April 14, 1908 and is buried in the Burrus Cemetery in Benoit, Mississippi.[^173]

Thirty years after his service in the War of Independence of Texas, now impoverished Samuel Chambliss immigrated to Texas in 1867 and settled in Navarro County. The country was familiar to him although he had last seen it in 1836. He was elected to the Texas State Legislature in 1873 and represented Freestone, Limestone and Navarro Counties in the 14th Texas Legislature.[^174]

In early July 1868 Nathaniel Chambliss died and on July 9, 1868 his son-in-law, Leonidas Hudspeth, (Martha’s husband) was named administrator of the estate. This was a period of great financial stress and many plantations were idle. The estate remained in the Probate Court of Lavaca County over four years because it was bankrupt.[^175] To pay the estate’s outstanding debts, all assets were sold except the widow’s homestead of 200 acres. The land-grant tract of 640 acres in Erath County was sold for $192 (30 cents per acre).[^176]

In later years, Nathaniel’s son-in-law, Leonidas Hudspeth, was the physician in charge of the City Hospital of Houston. He examined his wife’s uncle, old Samuel Lee Chambliss, and declared him to be disabled due to his war wounds.[^177] On July 2, 1874 Samuel L. Chambliss was granted a state pension for his service in the Texas War of Independence in 1836.[^178] A bill passed by the Legislature on July 28, 1876 for relief of Texas veteran pensioners, led Samuel Chambliss to swear that he was, on August 30, 1879, indigent and unable to support himself. He stated that he owned only his horse valued at $50 and a cow and calf valued at $20. In lieu of a pension he received a Republic Donation Voucher for 1280 acres for his service in the War for Texas Independence.[^179]
