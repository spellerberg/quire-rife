# Thomas Rife in West Texas, 1848-1851

## Frontier Defense, 1848

*“At the close of the Mexican war he was honorably discharged, but he did not seek rest, although he had nearly six years of service, for in 1848 he joined Ben Hill’s frontier company”, “Custodian of the Alamo,” San Antonio Light, February 23, 1887.*

### Indian raids into Texas and northern Mexico continued during the Mexican War.

The frequency and intensity of Native American raids into Texas and northern Mexico seemed to increase during the Mexican War. Northern Comanche raiders stole an estimated 10,000 horses and mules from the states of Durango and Chihuahua during the winter of 1845-1846.[^1] In 1849, when a survey party led by Captain Whiting reached the Pecos River, they were surprised to find a heavily used trail between Buffalo Gap and Comanche Springs. They surmised that it was, “a large Comanche war path which filled us with much astonishment, close together, 25 deep worn and much used trails made a great road, which told us that this was a highway by which each year the Comanche of the North desolate Durango and Chihuahua.”[^2]

During this turbulent period the line of settlement in south Texas continued to move westward. Prior to February 1843 there were no Anglo settlements west of San Pedro Creek (on San Antonio’s west side today) but between 1844 and 1852 fifteen small settlements were established west of the Medina River. All were in constant conflict with hostile Native Americans.[^3] Indian incursions south and east of Indian trails between Las Moras Creek and the Leona River were frequent until about 1857.[^4] Until 1846 Hays and his company of rangers provided protection for Castro’s Colony. However, when the Mexican War began Hays and most other Indian fighters left for the War; their departure left the frontier settlements unprotected.[^5]

### Settlers west of Castroville had troubles with Indians.

The European settlers at Quihi Lake were not armed and did nothing to threaten the Indians. However, they did occupy land around Quihi Lake that was previously used as an Indian campground.[^6] Luckily, the immigrants were extremely poor and had no horses or mules to tempt the Indian raiders.[^7] Nevertheless, a week after the settlers arrived at Quihi Lake, Lipan Apache men killed the Brinkhoff family and kidnapped two boys.[^8] Henri Castro, the impresario (land contractor), had an agreement with the Southern Comanche that provided a basis for peaceful relations between his settlers and the Indians. Unfortunately, in 1846, Texan freighters killed several Comanche Indians at Quihi Lake and the Indians retaliated by attacking Castro’s settlers. To prevent further incidents, Captain John Conner’s ranging company was stationed on the Medina River above Castroville on July 31, 1846.

In September 1846, fifty families settled at Vandenburgh on Verde Creek, about five miles west of Quihi[^9] and in February 1847, twenty-nine families settled at D’Hanis, 25 miles west of Castroville.[^10] As early as October 1846, the Federal government recognized the need to provide some protection to settlers west of Castroville but nothing was done that year.[^11] On August 11, 1847 Lieutenant-Colonel P. H. Bell and two companies[^12] were detached from Colonel Hays’regiment of 1st Texas Mounted Volunteers[^13] with orders to protect settlers from Indian raids.[^14] These units were mustered into service as US volunteers and operated jointly under the supervision of Headquarters, US Army Post of San Antonio and under the personal orders of Governors J. P. Henderson and G. T. Wood.[^15]

In March 1848, Lipan and Kickapoo Indians raided the settlement at Quihi. They briefly kidnapped Mrs. Francesca Charobiny and killed her brother, Blas Meyer. That same month, Charles DeMontel’s ranging company was sent to the area and established their camp on Seco Creek, two miles from D’Hanis. Captain John Conner’s company was returned to the Medina River above Castroville.[^16] The Governor authorized the formation of four additional ranging companies in 1848.[^17]

### Rife enlisted in a ranging company operating west of Castroville in the fall of 1848.

Thomas Rife and the men of Major Lane’s battalion serving with the Army of Occupation in northern Mexico were mustered out of Federal service on June 30, 1848,[^18] at Ciudad Camargo.[^19] Rife probably returned to his uncle’s farm in Washington County for a few months. He was now 25 years old and had been a soldier for much of the last six years. However, he apparently decided that he was not yet ready to settle down to life on a farm. Like many other young men in his situation, he was restless.

Rife traveled to San Antonio and on October 27, 1848, was mustered into Benjamin F. Hill’s Company of P. Hansbrough Bell’s Regiment of Texas Mounted Volunteers.[^20] The mission of the company was to protect the frontier. He enlisted as a Sergeant. His horse was valued at 80 dollars and his horse equipment at 15 dollars.[^21] The company was composed of men recruited in Bastrop and San Antonio but was mustered into Federal service at San Antonio[^22] and served less than two months. The company was mustered out of Federal service on December 17[^23] at San Antonio.[^24]

After receiving supplies, the company left San Antonio for the settlements to the west. In November 1848, a squad of probably three rangers[^25] led by Sgt. Rife (A.J. Sowell mistakenly gave his rank as Captain) arrived at the settlement of D’Hanis to protect the isolated Anglo settlers living there. The rangers camped on Seco Creek (then called Arroyo Seco) two miles from the settlement at what was already called Ranger’s Camp.[^26] They provided game for the Alsatian-born settlers in addition to protecting them from Indians.[^27]

### Rife’s unit killed Delaware Bob.

After their arrival at D’Hanis, the rangers under Sgt. Rife arrested an Indian man for kidnapping Mrs. Charobiny and killing her brother earlier that year.[^28] The rangers understood that this man was a Lipan Apache. They took their captive to Mrs. Charobiny, who was fourteen and newlywed, to see if she recognized him as the man who had kidnapped her eight months earlier. She replied that "all Indians looked the same to her" and that she could not identify him.

Instead of returning to their camp, the rangers went to a house in the settlement where whiskey was sold from a barrel. They ended up staying in the settlement all night drinking whiskey and during the night their captive was killed. Some of the settlers said he was Old Delaware Bob, a harmless and friendly Indian. In the morning, the Rangers dragged his body to an empty field near the settlement and left him there for hogs to eat.[^29] (The two rangers with Rife may have been named Allen and West.)[^30]

Residents of South Texas remarked that, while the Lipan Apaches were friendly prior to 1847, they “went on the war path” after the young chief Flacco was killed and their camping grounds west of San Antonio were occupied by Anglo settlers.[^31] Others said that the Lipan Indians “became bitter foes of the white race” after a drunken ranger killed a Lipan.[^32] They may have been referring to the murder of Rife’s captive at D’Hanis.

### The ranging companies were disbanded in December 1848.

Shortly thereafter, General Twiggs ordered that all ranging companies still in Federal service be disbanded.[^33] Before December 9, 1848, a company of US Dragoons replaced Hill’s Company on the Medina River. US Army Dragoons also replaced the ranging companies commanded by Captains Ross, Conner and McCulloch.[^34] In July 1849, the US Army built Fort Lincoln at the site of the rangers camp on Seco Creek; two companies of US Army troops were stationed there.[^35]

On December 17, 1848, Rife was mustered out of Federal service along with the rest of Benjamin Hill’s Company.[^36] He was due all his pay accrued since enrollment. The ordinance officer deducted $2.50 from his pay for lost equipment: i.e. one dollar for a cartridge box, 75 cents for a carbine sling and 75 cents for a sling swivel.[^37] Nine days later, on December 26, 1848, Benjamin F. Hill was elected without opposition as Sheriff of Bexar County.[^38] Perhaps as a result of his service in the Mexican War, Rife received a bounty from the State of Texas.[^39] He promptly sold his bounty land claim for an unknown sum to Vance and Bros., a large San Antonio merchant and banking firm.[^40]

## Topographic Engineers, 1848

*“Some time he was engaged with Colonel Joseph E. Johnson and Lieutenant Bryan in hunting out and opening the El Paso roads.” “Custodian of the Alamo,” San Antonio Light, February 23, 1887.*

### In 1848 the US Army built roads linking San Antonio and California.

When the United States and Mexico signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the US was given sovereignty over what became the States of New Mexico, Arizona and California. At that time, the only road linking the United States with the newly acquired Territory of New Mexico was the Santa Fé Trail.[^41]

Until 1849, there was no direct route between San Antonio and the upper Rio Grande valley. A trail between San Antonio and Santa Fé existed during the Spanish period but it was suitable only for pack animals. This road was dangerous and rarely used. Before the Mexican War the only usable road between San Antonio and El Paso del Norte ran through Saltillo, Hidalgo del Parral and Chihuahua City in order to avoid the Despoblado area of West Texas and northern Mexico.[^42]

Not only was the Despoblado an unexplored desert[^43] without a single Mexican or Anglo resident,[^44] it was also the traditional territory of Mescalero Apache Indians.[^45] In addition to the menace from Apaches, Comanche trails from what is now Oklahoma and north-central Texas ran through the Despoblado to Mexico.[^46] The presence of Comanche raiders prevented settlement in the Despoblado.[^47]

The 11th Article of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo guaranteed that the US would prevent Indians from raiding into Mexico[^48] although neither the Spanish nor the Mexicans had ever been able to accomplish this. The treaty required the US to build military posts to block movement of Indians across the border. The border itself had to be surveyed and marked. The merchants of San Antonio hoped also to secure some share of the lucrative trade with northern Mexico that passed through St. Louis and Santa Fé.[^49] For these and other reasons,[^50] the US Secretary of War sent Brevet Major General William Worth to Texas. He had instructions to examine the country on the north bank of the Rio Grande from San Antonio to Santa Fé[^51] and to construct a road to connect San Antonio with New Mexico and California.[^52]

### Upper and Lower Military Roads were built to El Paso del Norte.

The first effort after the Mexican War to open a road to the New Mexico Territory was made by Colonel John C. Hays and Ranger Captain Samuel Highsmith leading a thirty-five-man escort of Texas Rangers. This expedition left San Antonio August 27, 1848, and returned on December 20. While unsuccessful in finding a route to El Paso, they did happen upon a good route to Presidio.[^53]

Two months after the Hays expedition returned, General Worth and the citizens of San Antonio sent out a second exploring expedition. Major Robert Neighbors and John S. Ford were charged with finding a route for the movement of troops as well as for commercial purposes.[^54] This expedition mapped out what became known as the Upper El Paso-San Antonio Road.[^55]  

On February 12, 1849, another group of 16 men led by US Army engineers Captain William Whiting and Lieutenant William Smith left San Antonio to reconnoiter the entire region between San Antonio and west Texas. Their instructions were to find a suitable road for military and commercial purposes and to select suitable sites for military posts.[^56] This group followed the Upper Road between Fredericksburg and the upper Rio Grande valley but returned along the more southern route that was followed by the Hays Expedition.[^57] On the return trip to San Antonio they mapped out the southern or Lower El Paso-San Antonio Road.[^58]  

### The Lower Military Road was chosen as the preferred route.

Both John Ford and Captain Whiting recommended the southern route (the Lower road) because they found too few waterholes along the northern route (the Upper road) to support the large number of animals needed to haul freight wagons.[^59] The Army engineers agreed that the Lower road was the preferred route.

In June 1849 General Worth dispatched a much larger military party with civilian laborers[^60] to test and improve the lower route located by the Whiting-Smith Expedition.[^61] Major Jefferson Van Horne commanded six companies of the 3rd Regiment of US Infantry and their support personnel. The men of Company E, 3rd Regiment, 3rd US Infantry and a small group of civilian employees constructed the road to US Government specifications. It was better and wider than most roads of the day.[^62]

The fatigue party of soldiers and civilian workers cleared the road of boulders and widened it for use by wagons. “Two weeks were spent at Devil’s River cutting down the bank before wagons could get down into the channel” stated John L. Mann in the February 20, 1898, edition of the Dallas Morning News.[^63] They also cleared and enlarged the waterholes located by Captain Whiting.[^64]

Over 1,000 oxen, a large number of mules and several emigrant trains, each with large herds of cattle, followed the military’s train of 275 wagons.[^65] The wagon train also included individuals seeking their fortune in the West.[^66] Captain Jack Hays had been appointed Indian Sub-Agent on the Gila River also accompanied the train.[^67] The huge wagon trains of civilians trailed along behind, waiting for the army to open each stretch of road before proceeding.[^68]

The train left San Antonio in late May of 1849 and traveled from León Springs through the settlements of Castroville, Quihi and Vandenburg. It reached the Leona River (present-day Uvalde) on June 3 and San Felipe Springs (present-day Del Rio) on June 8, 1849.) There the large train was broken up into smaller segments preparatory to entering the desert where both water and forage were scarce.[^69]

Instead of following the obvious route up the Rio Grande, the road left the river at Devil’s River to its headwaters at Beaver Lake before turning northwest across tableland to Howard’s Well and the Pecos River. This detour was necessitated by a plateau cut by deep canyons west of the Pecos River and north of the Rio Grande. The canyons run in a general southeasterly direction and empty into either the Pecos River or the Rio Grande. A traveler heading west or east would have to ascend and descend these ridges making the route too difficult to cross with loaded wagons.[^70]

After crossing the Pecos, the road turned west and reached Comanche Springs, present-day Fort Stockton. Beyond Comanche Spring the train crossed the timber-covered Davis Mountains and then another stretch of desert. The train went from waterhole to waterhole until it crossed the Quitman Mountains and came to the Rio Grande, 100 miles south of El Paso del Norte. The train then followed the Rio Grande upstream to San Elizario, Socorro and Ysleta and reached an American-owned ranch across the river from El Paso del Norte[^71] on September 8, 1849.[^72]

This 600-mile road became the main route to the west from San Antonio[^73] until 1883 when the southern transcontinental railroad (now the Southern Pacific RR) opened for service.

### The route of the Lower Military road was determined by availability of water.

The route of the road was chosen largely because of the availability of water and grass along the route.[^74] The terrain and the location of river crossings ultimately determined the exact route chosen for these wagon roads. The road led from one water source to the next; sometimes it was a river, sometimes a spring. As new sources of water were discovered, the route of the road changed to shorten the distance between waterholes. When the overland mail ran on the Lower Road, stage stations were placed at intervals of about 25 or 30 miles apart where water was  found and where forage could be stored.

The availability of forage for mules and horses was of paramount importance. Between San Antonio and the Pecos River, the grass vegetation was either prairie grassland (tall grass) or desert grassland (mesquite grass), both of which were suitable for horses and mules.[^75] Between the Pecos River and the Davis Mountains desert vegetation (creosote bush) dominated and both water and forage were scarce. While both were available in the Davis Mountains, to the west another long stretch of dry desert had to be crossed until the road met the Rio Grande River at Quitman Pass.

There were many rivers to cross and finding a suitable crossing was imperative. The Pecos was particularly difficult as it was a rapidly flowing stream for three hundred miles upstream of the Rio Grande. It was 65’ to 100’ wide, 7’ to 10’ deep and usually the color of red mud.[^76] The river generally ran between steep banks, making it difficult for animals to get close enough to the river to drink and quicksand was common.[^77] The crossings at Live Oak Creek and Horsehead were two of the few suitable and both were old Indian raiding trails to Mexico.[^78] The El Paso-San Antonio Road utilized these same river crossings.

### Americans settled east of the Rio Grande near El Paso del Norte.

The first settlement encountered after reaching the Rio Grande was San Elizario (San Elceario prior to 1852), the most populous town in the trans-Pecos region and the eastern-most town in the upper Rio Grande valley.[^79] Between San Elizario and El Paso, Del Norte Mexicans and Suma and Piro Indian farmers inhabited the river valley.[^80] The American settlement was just the three houses comprising Coonz or Coontz Ranch. On September 8, 1849, the US Army built the “Post Opposite El Paso” on Coontz’ Ranch and manned it with six companies of US infantry. Two companies of US troops were also quartered in the town of San Elizario.[^81]

In 1848 migrants to the California gold rush were already traveling through San Antonio along the Lower Road rather than traveling through Mexico or over the Isthmus of Panama. The older route through Parras and northern Mexico to Mazatlán was still in use and would continue to be used for many years. It was much shorter than the overland route to California and avoided the Arizona desert. The route through Mazatlán also avoided contact with the Apache Indians who, after 1849, no longer considered Americans their allies.[^82] Routes through Parras rather than El Paso had an additional advantage; Comanche raiders rarely ventured that far south.[^83]

A San Antonio newspaper reported on August 4, 1849, that upwards of 4,000 emigrants with 1,200 to 1,500 wagons were camped on the Rio Grande near Coontz’ ranch on their way to California.[^84]

### The Upper Presidio Road went to Eagle Pass.

During the summer of 1849, Colonel Joseph E. Johnston and Lieutenant Bryan engaged Tom Rife to hunt out and open roads in west Texas.[^85] He may have accompanied the Topographic Engineers on the road-building expedition to Coontz’ Ranch from June until October 1849 but there is no evidence of that. However, he did escort Army surveyors laying out the Upper Presidio Road between San Antonio and Eagle Pass.[^86] This road began at Uvalde on the Lower San Antonio-El Paso Road and followed the route of Woll’s Road to Eagle Pass on the Rio Grande.[^87] Rife was among the first anglo men to live in the vicinity of Uvalde and may have served as a guide or a guard for the surveying party. The following year Rife once again joined a ranging company.

## Wallace’s Ranger Company, 1850-1851

*“Two years later he joined Big Foot Wallace’s frontier company and one year afterwards he was mustered out...” “Custodian of the Alamo,” San Antonio Light, February 23, 1887.*

### After the Mexican War, the US Army again took Texas rangers into Federal service.

When the United States Congress annexed the Republic of Texas the expectation was that the US Army would provide for the defense of the frontier and that Texas troops would be called into State service only at the request and expense of Federal authorities.[^88] By 1849, it became apparent that the US Army by itself was unable to prevent Indian depredations in Texas. Thomas Rife participated in an experiment that for a year and a half, beginning in 1850, tested whether a mixture of US and State troops could keep Indians from raiding into the settled areas of Texas.

In the 1850s, the line of settlement in Texas advanced 10 miles per year to the west.[^89] The Texas frontier was 500 miles long and 125 miles deep by the end of the decade. To prevent Indians from raiding along this frontier and into the settled parts of Texas and Mexico, the US Army built a line of outposts or forts west of the line of settlement. In 1849, the line of seven posts extended from the Red River in the north to the Nueces River in the south. An additional six posts were located along the Rio Grande River.[^90] By 1854, six military posts north of Fort Inge were abandoned and eight new posts were constructed further west.

After 1856, the US Army manned two defensive lines on the frontier.[^91] Infantry manned the outer line and mounted troops manned the inner line.[^92] In theory, the infantry formed a picket line to warn the mounted troops of the approach of Indian raiding parties.[^93] The mounted troops then blocked the Indian’s advance into the settlements. The mounted troops consisted of dragoons, Mounted Rifles and, after 1856, cavalry.[^94]

It was the strategy of the US military to force the Indians to “retire beyond the line of Posts.”[^95] Only in this way, the government reasoned, could the two people, Anglos and Mexicans on one hand and free Indians on the other, hope to live in peace. Most Indians also believed this. The Comanche chiefs, in their negotiations with Sam Houston, repeatedly asked for a fixed border between themselves and the settlers.[^96] However, the steady westward movement of the line of settlement and the Comanche tradition of stealing horses from south Texas and Mexico made this solution impossible.

### Fort Inge was built to guard the frontier.

Fort Lincoln (two miles from D’Hanis) and Fort Inge (thirty miles to the west) were important forts in the first chain of military posts built after the Mexican War.[^97] On March 13, 1849, Company I commanded by Captain Seth Eastman of the 1st US Infantry, established a camp called Camp Leona (or Post on the Leona) on the east bank of Leona River, four miles north of Woll’s Crossing.[^98] The site is one mile south of the present town of Uvalde between a 140-foot volcanic plug called Mt. Inge and the Leona River.[^99] On March 24, Company D, 1st Infantry, arrived and in December 1849, the encampment on the Leona was renamed Fort Inge.[^100]

Fort Inge was typical of the one-company US Army bases of the period.[^101] The soldiers built the fort themselves.[^102] Most buildings were of jacal (post and mud) construction and were considered to be temporary.[^103] A hospital, added later, and a stone wall, built during the Civil War, were the only permanent structures at the fort.[^104]

In 1849, when US Army Major General George M. Brooke assumed command of the 8th Military Department (the Department of Texas), it had a total roster of 1,500 infantry, artillery and dragoons.[^105] Nevertheless, Comanche raiders continued to cross into Mexico in great numbers. In 1849, Ben McCulloch, who traveled through northern Mexico on his way to California, reported that, “The Indians are breaking up the frontier settlements all along the route we came, being worse than they were ever known.”[^106] Indians were raiding into Texas as well and in May 1849 the Army took steps to reinforce the Texas line.[^107]

### General Brooke called for Texas volunteers in 1849.

Realizing that his regular soldiers could not prevent Indian raids into Texas by themselves, the US Army general commanding the Department of Texas determined to employ State troops to assist them.[^108] On August 11, 1849, General Brooke, in Orders No. 53, notified his command that, “In consequence of the repeated and continued depredations of the Indians, the commanding general has determined to make a requisition on his Excellency Governor George T. Wood of Texas for three mounted companies of Rangers.[^109]

On that same day, General Brooke wrote to the Governor of Texas saying that he had been authorized by the President of the U.S. to request that the Governor authorize three companies of 78 rangers each for Federal Service.[^110] The ranging area of the three companies would be in the vicinity of Goliad, Corpus Christi, Bexar County and other places that the Indians had recently raided.[^111]

In Order No. 57, written on August 19, 1849, George Deas, Assistant Adjunct to General Brooke, wrote that, “The Commanding General in thus calling for the services of volunteers, in preference to making a requisition for an additional number of regular troops, pays a just tribute to the favorable consideration in which the Texas Ranger is held, for the performance of the harassing and arduous duties of a frontier soldier. The General feels confident that the well-earned fame of the hardy sons of Texas will, in their coming sphere of action, be well sustained, by a vigorous prosecution of their campaign, and hopes, that long ere their term of service shall have expired, we shall no longer be annoyed by the presence, within our settlements, of the audacious and marauding savage.”[^112]

The Governor responded quickly to General Brooke’s request and commissioned John S. Ford, J.B. McCown, and R.E. Sutton to organize the three companies.[^113] At the call of the three captains, prospective rangers each arrived at the appointed rendezvous[^114] with their horse, saddle, saddle blanket, bridle, halter and lariat[^115] as well as clothing and blankets.[^116] The following day, the captains selected 78 men to form a company as specified in General Brooks’ Order.[^117]  After each company was organized, the company elected a Captain, a 1st Lieutenant and a 2nd Lieutenant.[^118] The Governor had previously informed the Army when and where the troops would be available;[^119] on the appointed day an officer of the Army mustered the company into Federal Service using instructions provided by the War Department.[^120]

After being mustered in, the company left the rendezvous site and traveled to their designated Army post. The captain reported to the commanding officer for instructions.[^121] The Army ordinance officer issued the men arms consisting of a percussion rifle[^122] and a pistol with its holster.[^123] The men were also issued ammunition and camp and garrison equipment.[^124]

The companies organized by John Ford and J. B. McCown were ready to muster in on August 23, 1849.[^125] Each company consisted of one captain, one 1st lieutenant, one 2nd lieutenant, four sergeants, four corporals, two buglers, two farriers and blacksmiths, and 64 privates. After being mustered into service the company proceeded to Corpus Christi to report to the Commanding General for special instructions.[^126] John S.(Rip) Ford’s company was assigned to the area around Corpus Christi.[^127]

### Rife enlisted in Wallace’s ranging company in 1850.

On March 06, 1850, General Brooke called on Texas Governor P.H. Bell for a fourth similar company to be placed in Federal Service. General Brooke candidly stated to Governor Bell that, “there is, at present, no money in the Treasury for the payment of volunteers, but from assurances which I have received from the Honorable Secretary of War, I feel confident that an early appropriation to that effect, will be made by Congress.”[^128]

A few days later, William “Big Foot” Wallace was commissioned to raise a company of rangers in Bexar County for an enlistment of six months.[^129] On March 23, 1850, Captain William Steele of the 2nd Dragoons mustered the company into Federal service at 2pm at the Federal Arsenal in Austin.[^130] Captain Steele was required to “inspect closely each man and horse, and to reject both, or either, unless they appear sufficiently strong and capable of bearing the arduous duties and fatigues of an Indian campaign.” As was the custom, each man furnished his own horse, saddle, saddle blanket, bridle, halter and lariat and the government supplied a percussion rifle, pistol and ammunition.[^131] Afterwards, the company reported to the Commanding General in San Antonio for instructions.[^132]

This unit was paired with Colonel Hardee’s US Infantry stationed at Fort Inge.[^133] Wallace’s ranging company and Capt. William Hardee’s Company C, Second Dragoons both used Camp Leona as their base camp. The rangers camped on the west side of the river[^134] and the soldiers occupied two crude barracks on the east side of the river at Fort Inge. Both the US soldiers and the rangers were mounted riflemen. Regular soldiers at Fort Inge from 1849 to 1852 were Dragoons, who were trained to fight on horseback or on foot. Mounted infantry (who fought on foot) occupied the fort from 1852 to 1855. Between 1856 and 1861 the soldiers at Fort Inge were cavalry. Mounted infantry were mounted on horses when these were available but sometime used mules because horses were scarce in Texas. Rangers were always well mounted, entered the service with their own horses and could fight either mounted or on foot.   

The area of operation of Wallace’s company was between Seco Creek and the Guadalupe River from Bandera Pass to the coast.[^135] This area was sometimes called the Nueces Strip.[^136] As a result of the addition of Wallace’s company, Ford’s company took a new position at San Antonio Viejo in the lower Rio Grande valley to protect the vicinity of the Ringgold Barracks at Rio Grande City and Fort McIntosh at Laredo. Capt. McGown’s company was moved to an area between Ft. Inge on the Leona River and Fort Duncan on the Rio Grande at Eagle Pass.[^137]

A joint military campaign against Indians was launched in 1850. By June 04, 1850, General Brooke felt that he was ready to move against the numerous and bold Comanche and Lipan Indian raiders in south Texas. He issued order No. 27 on June 4 to all available Dragoon and Mounted Infantry at Forts McIntosh, Inge, Merrill, and Lincoln together with the ranging companies of Ford, Grumbles, McCown and Wallace. The troops were ordered to prepare to take the field, ”at an early date” against the Indians. The campaign would last at least two months or “until the country is cleared of those hostile Indians.” A detachment of Dragoons was left to protect Fort Inge on the Leona River and Fort Lincoln on Seco Creek, both of which were exposed to attacks by Lipan Apache Indians.[^138] Apparently, the entire garrisons of Forts McIntosh and Merrill were to take the field in this scout, leaving as few as four men to guard the forts.[^139]

Major Babbitt, Chief Assistant Quartermaster, was directed to establish depots of forage at Fort Merrill where the Corpus Christi-San Antonio Road crossed the Nueces River. Major Longstreet, Chief of the Subsistence Department, was directed to place supplies for the troops at Forts Merrill, Inge and Lincoln[^140] Colonel Hardee of the 2nd Dragoons was assigned to lead the scout.[^141] Wallace and his company were told to proceed towards Corpus Christi.[^142]

### Rife participated in the fight at Black Hills.

Nineteen men were on this scout including Edward Westfall[^143] and Tom Rife.[^144] On July 18, 1850, the rangers were returning northwest to their camp on the Leona River. As Wallace and his company examined the country from the Nueces to Espantosa Lake they encountered hostile Comanche Indians at Black Hills, a summit sixteen miles from Cotulla in present-day La Salle County.[^145] In the ensuing fight three rangers were wounded and seven Indians killed.

As the rangers approached a waterhole on Todos Santos Creek, about eighty mounted Comanche Indians, camped at the waterhole, came out to meet them. The rangers dismounted and prepared for an assault. The Indians stopped just out of gunshot range. Their leader repeatedly charged close to the rangers, encouraging his men to follow. On the third charge Wallace ordered three of his men to shoot the Indian leader’s horse while Wallace, with a large caliber rifle, shot the man through both hips. The rest of the Indians then charged forward to rescue their wounded leader. Some of the rangers mounted their horses and fought the Indians at close quarters, using their pistols.

With their leader wounded, the Indians retreated back to the waterhole with the rangers following close behind them. The Indians continued to retreat up the creek and left the rangers in possession of the waterhole. The Indians had been camped for a week or more making lariats and other items from rawhide. They were soaking the rawhide in the pool that was already low due to dry weather. The rangers, who were had been searching for water for some time, were horrified to find that the water was a seething mass of hair, maggots and rotting flesh. Wallace, Westfall and ten of their men rode to the upper waterhole only to find the Indians waiting to give battle.

Wallace returned to the first water hole, gathered his men and left. He waited for the Indians to retreat from the camp that afternoon before moving back in to get water for his horses and men. This fight resulted in three wounded rangers and seven Indians killed including the old chief.[^146] The wounded rangers were taken to the hospital at Fort Inge and the other men returned to the ranger camp at Edward Westfall’s ranch, twenty-seven miles below Fort Inge[^147] on the Leona River.[^148] Among the sick and wounded men were Linden Jackson, Rufus Halyard,[^149] Ephraim Rose and Louis Oget.[^150]

The fight at Black Hills and the story of the Mier Expedition were two of Wallace’s most famous stories. Newspaper reporter A. J. Sowell recorded one version of the fight at Black Hills in his book, “Life of “Big Foot” Wallace.” The Kerrville Mountain News edition of May 6, 1926, reprinted another long version of the fight “in Wallace’s own words.”[^151]

Two weeks after the fight at Black Hills, on August 5, 1850, Wallace and 23 rangers fought and vanquished 125 Indians on the Laredo road. The fight lasted seven hours and resumed the next day resulting in 20 Indians killed and 65 captured.[^152]

### The results of the 1850 campaign were unsatisfactory.

Despite the military’s best efforts to control the Indians, on July 26, 1850 the citizens of San Antonio met and passed a resolution declaring that the area between the Guadalupe River and the Rio Grande was infested and overrun with hostile savages.[^153] A similar petition was sent to General Brooks from Corpus Christi on August 15. Reports also came in of Indian attacks near Corpus Christi, Laredo and Eagle Pass.[^154]

General Brooks found it almost impossible to procure sufficient horses in Texas and he had been able to mount only one-half of the regular infantry. For this reason, he felt compelled to continue the service of the four mounted companies of volunteer rangers despite the problems they caused him. The Adjutant General R. Jones observed that, “great negligence was observed in the volunteers (rangers) in Texas in respect to muster rolls and returns required by the regulations, etc.”[^155] Only Captain John S. Ford, whose company was assigned to Fort McIntosh, submitted reports of combat actions. While the Texas ranging companies were organized as military units, their outlandish dress, long beards and errant behavior clearly distinguished them from federal soldiers.[^156] Despite General Brooks’ initial high opinion of the rangers,[^157] their refusal to act responsibly ultimately led to their dismissal from Federal Service. His experience with the Texas rangers mirrored that of General Zachary Taylor who ended the Mexican War very disenchanted with them. Their refusal to wear uniforms and salute officers and their tendency to prey upon on Mexican civilians had been very upsetting to General Taylor.[^158]

Despite General Brooks’ increasingly dim view of the rangers, on approximately August 23, 1850, Wallace’s company was mustered into service for a second term. In total, this company served for almost 1½ years in three consecutive 6-months terms. The enlistment term of Ford’s, Grumble’s and McCown’s companies also expired between August 23 and September 23, 1850. All four companies were mustered in for another term.[^159] Captain Grumble’s company mustered in on September with a new captain, James D. Bagby, after Captain Grumble died.[^160] Not all the men re-enlisted, some were killed or wounded and new men were constantly being recruited to keep the companies fully manned.[^161] When the Federal population census was taken on October 14, 1850, Thomas Rife was at Fort Inge in Bexar County on the Leona River with Wallace’s ranging company. He, or someone representing him, wrongly listed his age as 25 and stated that he was born in Mississippi.[^162]

Late in 1850, General Brooke added one more ranging company to his command for a total of five companies. On November 4, 1850, Henry McCulloch organized a company to be mustered into federal service to serve for 12 months. An article in a newspaper on October 26, 1850, announced the details. All desiring to join were to meet at Austin on November 4th with his own horse; saddle, bridle, blanket and clothing.[^163] Lieutenant Thomas J. Wood of the US Army then mustered the company into Federal service. Henry McCulloch was elected Captain with John R. King as his First Lieutenant and Calvin S. Turner, Second Lieutenant. The company was stationed in Refugio County on the Gulf coast in the neighborhood of the port town of Lamar on Aransas Bay.[^164]

On March 23, 1851, the second six-month term of enlistment of Wallace’s company expired. General Brooke requested, on February 7, 1851, that the Governor allow him to muster this company into Federal service for another six-month term if the men were agreeable to doing so. He made the same request of the companies commanded by Bagby, Ford, McCown, and McCullough, all of whose enlistments were to expire between March 5 and May 5, 1851.[^165]

### General Brooke dismissed the ranging companies in 1851.

In the fall of 1851, General Brooke decided to end the experiment with State troops. He may have felt that he had achieved his goal of pushing the Indians west of the line of forts or he may have realized the impossibility of doing so. Two other factors may have prompted General Brooke to change his strategy. After Congress voted to pay Texas to settle its land claims in New Mexico Territory in 1850, every appropriation involving Texas came under intense scrutiny. Congress would have denied further funding for the employment of State troops if Congress believed Federal infantry troops could do the same job at half the cost.[^166] Another factor involved the often erratic and unprofessional behavior of the rangers.[^167] The ranging company stationed near Rio Grande City (opposite Camargo) became involved as mercenaries in the so-called Merchant War. Their actions angered the Governor[^168] and General Brooke dismissed all five companies of Texas rangers in federal service after that incident. On September 23, 1851, after the third six-month term of service expired, the experiment ended and Wallace’s Company was mustered out after a year and a half of service.[^169]
